#### Options Market Participants

An option is a contract between a buyer and a seller. Because of this, a common question from new option traders is, “Who exactly is buying from me or selling to me?”. While it’s of no consequence to the outcomes of your trades, understanding this can help you understand how the options market works.

So, let’s take a moment to answer this question when you buy or sell an option, who is on the other side of that transaction? The answer is a  **market maker**.

The job of a market maker is to facilitate the trade. However, this doesn’t always mean that market makers take the other side of the trade and are bearish when you’re bullish, or vice versa. In fact, in most cases their goal is to not have to hold the other side of the trade (though they will if no other traders are interested). Instead, they aim to match up buyers with sellers so that they don’t have to take the other side and take on more risk. To achieve this, they change the price of options up or down to make the other side more attractive to prospective traders.

Because market makers are always there to buy or sell options, they can be seen as an economic good. To understand this, put yourself in the shoes of a portfolio manager. Suppose you need to buy a particular options contract to manage the risk of your portfolio. It’s beneficial to you that there is someone out there willing to make a deal with you and offer you what you’re looking for. Of course, if you’re asking for something that isn’t widely traded, the price may not be favorable.

While market makers are an important part of a well-functioning financial system, they’re not a charitable organization. There’s some money in it for them too. Market makers make money from the bid/ask spread. When market makers list the prices of an option, they set a  **bid**, or buying price, and an  **ask**, or selling price. Their goal is to find a buyer who’s willing to pay the bid, and a seller who’s willing to accept the ask, and match them up. The difference between the bid and the ask, known as the  **bid/ask spread**, is the market maker’s cut. It’s the cost of their services.

The bid and the ask are a function of  **supply and demand**. If more people are willing to buy and sell options, competition for prices increases among market makers. This higher volume of trading typically results in narrower spreads. A market with high volume and narrow spreads is often called a  **liquid** market. Liquidity is good for option traders because it reduces the bid/ask spread and gives traders more confidence that they’ll be able to find a buyer or seller at a desirable price.
