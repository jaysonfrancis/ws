#### Futures Contract Specifications

In this lesson, we’ll explore the different aspects of a futures contract, what the contract means for buyers and sellers, and how profits and losses occur. We’ll also break down the margin involved with futures trading and how to place trades.

You’ll remember that a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. These contracts are issued and regulated by futures exchanges and standardized for quality, quantity, and delivery. Contracts also have identifying details including a name, symbol, exchange, trading hours, contract size, tick size, and contract value. Here’s an S&P 500 E-Mini futures contract as an example:

*Futures Symbols*

We’ll start with futures names and symbols. Let’s look at an example using one of the most commonly traded futures, the **E-mini S&P 500.** The E-mini S&P 500 equity index futures is identified by the root symbol “**ES**”. The full symbol, however, also includes an identifier for the expiration month and year of contract. For example, **/ESZ19**. Let’s break down the full symbol one piece at a time.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/FT_Lesson2_10.3.jpg)

We’ll start with the  **forward slash**. It has no meaning other than signifying that the symbol being traded is a **futures contract**. This helps avoid confusion with certain stock symbols. For example, /CL is the symbol for crude oil futures. CL without the forward slash is the stock symbol for Colgate-Palmolive. With the forward slash, you’re trading crude oil; without the forward slash, you’re trading a Consumer Staples company.

The next part of the futures symbol is the  **root** symbol. This is the product identifier. In our /ESZ19 example, the “ES” signifies the S&P 500 E-mini futures contract. The table below shows root symbols of some equity indices.

The third item in the symbol is the  **month of expiration**. This letter corresponds with a certain month. In our /ESZ19 example, the letter Z denotes a December expiration. The E-mini S&P 500 contract has quarterly expirations, March (H), June (M), September (U), and December (Z). The contract expires on the third Friday of the expiration month.

The final item in the symbol is the  **year of expiration**. In our /ESZ19 example, the 19 represents 2019. The frequency of expiration varies among futures contracts. The E-mini S&P 500 futures has quarterly expiration cycles. Some futures contracts have monthly expirations, like Crude Oil (/CL).  **It’s important to know when a contract expires before trading it**. To see a futures contract expiration on thinkorswim, go to the  **Trade** tab, and enter its symbol.

*Tick Size*

Next, we’ll discuss the tick size. The  **tick size**  is the minimum price increment a particular contract can fluctuate. A stock’s tick size is equal to a penny, meaning the minimum price movement is up or down one penny (+/- 0.01).

However, in futures, tick sizes vary. For example, the tick size for the E-mini S&P 500 is 0.25 index points. The /ES can go from 2,667.25 to 2,667.50 to 2,667.75, etc. It only trades in quarter increments. Oil ticks in penny increments, while the E-mini Dow Jones futures ticks in whole dollars.  **It’s important to understand tick size before trading any futures contract**.

*Multiplier*

Each contract also has a standardized multiplier. The  **multiplier**  is determined by the  **contract size**  and is set by the exchange. Just like tick sizes, multipliers can vary by product. For example, the /ES has a multiplier of $50.

The multiplier is used to calculate the financial, or notional, value of a contract. To calculate the  **notional value**  of one contract, multiply the current price by the contract multiplier. For example, if the /ES was trading at 2,250, the notional value of the contract would be $112,500 (2,250 x $50). Notional value can help you determine how much of your portfolio a contract could offset in a hedge, which we’ll discuss more in the next lesson.

With knowing the tick size and multiplier, we can calculate what a one point move would be. For example, because the /ES tick size is 0.25, a tick is worth $12.50 (0.25 x $50). In other words, a one point move in the /ES is equal to $50.  **It’s important to know the multiplier and how to calculate notional value before trading any futures contract**.

*Hours*

In addition to standardizing the contracts, exchanges set the  **trading hours**. Futures trading is available almost 23 hours per day, six days per week for most products. These hours vary from product to product, and some periods of the day are more active than others.

Contract multipliers and trading hours are available on the [Futures Data](https://www.tdameritrade.com/client/futures/futures_data.html) page on tdameritrade.com.

*Expiration and Settlement*

The final contract specifications we’ll discuss are  **expiration**,  **delivery**, and  **settlement**. Because futures contracts have expiration dates, they have a defined end date on the calendar and will eventually cease to exist. Typically, traders either close out or roll their futures positions to a contract with a further expiration date prior to expiration. Futures contracts are either physically settled or financially settled, also called “cash settled,” at expiration. Let’s discuss each.

**Physical settlement**  results in the buyer paying the notional value of the contract and receiving the underlying product, while the seller receives the cash and delivers the underlying product. For an oil contract, this means the buyer receives and pays for 1,000 barrels of oil, and the seller delivers and accepts the money for 1,000 barrels of oil.

**Financial**  or  **cash settlement**  of futures contracts credits or debits both the buyer and the seller at expiration depending on the final settlement price. For example, if a trader bought an /ES contract at 2,650 and the final settlement price at expiration was 2,660, the trader would receive a $500 credit to her account (10 point gain x $50 multiplier). The trader who sold the contract at 2,650 would be debited $500 at expiration. Both traders would see their contracts expire at expiration upon settlement.
