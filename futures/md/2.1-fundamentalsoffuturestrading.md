You’ll remember that a futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. These contracts are issued and regulated by futures exchanges and standardized for quality, quantity, and delivery. Contracts also have identifying details including a name, symbol, exchange, trading hours, contract size, tick size, and contract value. Here’s an S&P 500 E-Mini futures contract as an example:

*Futures Symbols*

We’ll start with futures names and symbols. Let’s look at an example using one of the most commonly traded futures, the **E-mini S&P 500.** The E-mini S&P 500 equity index futures is identified by the root symbol “**ES**”. The full symbol, however, also includes an identifier for the expiration month and year of contract. For example, **/ESZ19**. Let’s break down the full symbol one piece at a time.

We’ll start with the  **forward slash**. It has no meaning other than signifying that the symbol being traded is a **futures contract**. This helps avoid confusion with certain stock symbols. For example, /CL is the symbol for crude oil futures. CL without the forward slash is the stock symbol for Colgate-Palmolive. With the forward slash, you’re trading crude oil; without the forward slash, you’re trading a Consumer Staples company.
