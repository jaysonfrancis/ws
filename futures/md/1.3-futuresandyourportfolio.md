#### Futures and Your Portfolio

Futures are an **active trading** strategy. Because they have a built-in expiration and a high degree of risk, they should not be considered a passive investment that makes up a major portion of a long-term portfolio, like stocks or bonds. Instead, traders often designate only a portion of their active trading account to futures. There are typically two ways individual traders use futures in a portfolio: speculation and hedging. Remember, when talking about retail trading, speculating and hedging mean something a little different than they do in the broader futures market. In the broader market, all retail traders are considered “speculators” because they’re attempting to profit from changes in futures prices. But when talking about managing a portfolio, speculation means trying to capitalize on changes in the futures price in order to grow a portfolio, while hedging means using futures to potentially reduce risk.
