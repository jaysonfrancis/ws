#### Futures and Your Portfolio

Futures are an **active trading** strategy. Because they have a built-in expiration and a high degree of risk, they should not be considered a passive investment that makes up a major portion of a long-term portfolio, like stocks or bonds. Instead, traders often designate only a portion of their active trading account to futures. 

There are typically two ways individual traders use futures in a portfolio: **speculation** and **hedging**. Remember, when talking about retail trading, speculating and hedging mean something a little different than they do in the broader futures market. In the broader market, all retail traders are considered “speculators” because they’re attempting to profit from changes in futures prices. But when talking about managing a portfolio, speculation means trying to capitalize on changes in the futures price in order to grow a portfolio, while hedging means using futures to potentially reduce risk.

*Speculation in a Portfolio*

Similar to stock investing, futures **speculators** try to *predict* the direction of upcoming price movements of a futures contract. Also, similar to stocks, speculators can choose to take long or short positions: however, shorting futures tends to be less complicated than shorting stocks. We’ll discuss this process later. 

For now, let’s look at an example:

Imagine a trader is **bullish** on oil, thinking the price of oil will go up. He goes long, buying one crude oil contract at $60, then oil increases to $65 and he exits the trade by selling the contract. In this example, the trader profits from the increase in price. This demonstrates how a speculator can profit from price fluctuations.
