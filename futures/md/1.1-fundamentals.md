#### Futures

Futures trade across six different types of assets, virtually around the clock. They provide traders with the flexibility to diversify their portfolios and respond to events that may occur outside normal stock market trading hours. However, futures can be fast-moving and have a high degree of risk, so education is essential for anyone interested in trading this product. To get started, let’s discuss what a futures contract is, how futures are traded, and why individual traders may be drawn to this investment type.

A  **futures contract**  is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. This means futures contracts allow market participants to offset or assume the risk of a price change of an asset over time. For example, let’s say oil is trading at $74 and a trader buys an oil futures contract at $74. He now has the right to buy 1,000 barrels of oil at $74 at expiration. If the price of oil rises, the contract will be worth more. If the price of oil falls, the contract will be worth less. Thus, the trader assumes the risk and the returns associated with the fluctuations of the asset controlled by the contract.

A futures contract is a  **derivative**, meaning it “derives” its value from an underlying asset. When you trade futures, you aren’t actually buying or selling assets at the moment; you simply have an agreement to do so in the future. By initiating the contract, you’re able to  **lock in a price** for the underlying asset—so whether the price has risen or fallen, you pay or receive the original agreed-upon amount. Each contract is standardized with certain specifications as to the underlying assets such as  **delivery**,  **quality**, and  **quantity**. So, when the contract expires, you’re obligated to receive or deliver a specific quality and quantity of the underlying goods or the corresponding cash amount.

Futures are traded on a  **futures exchange**, a regulated and centralized place that facilitates the buying and selling of futures contracts. The exchange ensures that contracts will be honored, eliminating counterparty risk, or the risk that the other party won’t deliver on its part of the contract. By bringing legitimate buyers and sellers together on the same trading floor, the exchange enables traders to easily enter and exit the market. Most futures products trade 23 hours per day, six days per week.

*Why trade futures* 

Futures offer traders  **leverage**, which is the ability to commit a smaller amount of capital to control a larger asset. Therefore, futures contracts allow a trader to control a large underlying asset at a fraction of the actual cost of the asset.

Many traders use leverage because of the  **profit potential**. When using leverage to gain access to the potential profit of an asset like stock index futures, small changes in the underlying can potentially translate into large gains. However, traders must remember that the opposite is also true—leveraged instruments can magnify losses.

Finally, many traders use futures to  **add diversification**  to their portfolios because futures provide access to a wide variety of asset classes. Diversification usually reduces the overall risk of the portfolio.
