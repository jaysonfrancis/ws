#### Futures

Futures trade across six different types of assets, virtually around the clock. They provide traders with the flexibility to diversify their portfolios and respond to events that may occur outside normal stock market trading hours. However, futures can be fast-moving and have a high degree of risk, so education is essential for anyone interested in trading this product. To get started, let’s discuss what a futures contract is, how futures are traded, and why individual traders may be drawn to this investment type.

A  **futures contract**  is an agreement to buy or sell an asset at a predetermined price at a specified time in the future. This means futures contracts allow market participants to offset or assume the risk of a price change of an asset over time. For example, let’s say oil is trading at $74 and a trader buys an oil futures contract at $74. He now has the right to buy 1,000 barrels of oil at $74 at expiration. If the price of oil rises, the contract will be worth more. If the price of oil falls, the contract will be worth less. Thus, the trader assumes the risk and the returns associated with the fluctuations of the asset controlled by the contract.

A futures contract is a  **derivative**, meaning it “derives” its value from an underlying asset. When you trade futures, you aren’t actually buying or selling assets at the moment; you simply have an agreement to do so in the future. By initiating the contract, you’re able to  **lock in a price** for the underlying asset—so whether the price has risen or fallen, you pay or receive the original agreed-upon amount. Each contract is standardized with certain specifications as to the underlying assets such as  **delivery**,  **quality**, and  **quantity**. So, when the contract expires, you’re obligated to receive or deliver a specific quality and quantity of the underlying goods or the corresponding cash amount.
