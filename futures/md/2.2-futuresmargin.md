### Futures Margin

Unlike stocks, the current price of a futures contract is _not_ the amount of money required to trade that contract. Instead, when you buy or sell a futures contract, you set aside a certain amount of money called margin. **Futures margin** is the amount of money you must deposit and keep on hand with your broker when you open a futures position. Note that this is different than margin in stocks. With stocks, you borrow against your assets like a loan. With futures, the margin acts like a **good faith deposit** or a **performance bond**, which is set aside when the trade is placed.

There are two types of futures margin: **initial margin** and **maintenance margin**. The initial margin requirement is the amount a trader must put up to enter a futures position. Once the position is established, the trader is held to the maintenance margin requirement, which is typically about 10% less than the initial margin. Traders must keep this amount on hand to stay in the trade. For example, in 2018, the initial margin for the /ES was $6,600, and the maintenance margin was $6,000. This means buyers or sellers must have $6,600 in their account to enter one contract, and once the trade is established, keep $6,000 in the account to stay in that one position.

Both initial and maintenance margin levels are set by the exchanges; however, TDAFF reserves the right to increase margins at any time, which could happen on volatile products.

### How Margin Works

So, what happens after a position is established? The margin actually stays the same. What matters is the account value. If the trade goes as hoped, the account value should increase. But, if the trade goes the opposite way, the account value will likely decrease. Let’s discuss how this works.

Unlike stocks, where profits and losses are only realized when a position is closed, futures contracts realize profits and losses daily. Each trading day, the exchange determines futures’ **settlement price**.  The settlement price is then used to determine whether a realized profit (or loss) is credited (or debited) to your account. This daily cash adjustment to the account is called **mark-to-market** and will happen automatically.
