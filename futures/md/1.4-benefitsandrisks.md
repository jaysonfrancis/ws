#### Benefits and Risks of Futures Trading

Previously, we discussed what possibly attracts traders to the futures market, and we’ve touched on some of the risks. Let’s explore some additional benefits and risks of futures trading.

As we’ve mentioned, many traders are drawn to futures because of leverage. **Leverage**  means that a relatively small amount of capital can control a larger investment. It’s important to remember that leverage can be both a benefit and a risk: while it frees up capital, it can increase risk. Small changes in the underlying futures price can translate into large gains or losses. And traders could lose more than their initial investment.

Another benefit is that futures can provide a  **pure market view**—where the price of a futures contract is determined by market forces. To understand this, let’s compare trading oil versus trading an oil stock. When you trade oil in the futures market, you deal directly with the price of oil and the effects of supply and demand on the price of oil.

When trading oil stocks, you have added layers of analysis that include product sales, revenue, expenses, earnings, cash flows, management effectiveness, and more.

Another potential benefit of trading futures is  **diversification**. Portfolio diversification helps offset exposure in any single position and helps traders protect themselves against wide swings in key sectors. Remember, futures products span across six different types of assets including equity indices, energy, metals, interest rates, agriculture, and currencies. The wide range of products in futures helps to provide the flexibility to diversify any portfolio.
