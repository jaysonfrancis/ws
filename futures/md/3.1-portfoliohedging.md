### Portfolio Hedging

Now that we’ve covered some of the basics of futures, let’s explore one way to start using futures in a portfolio—hedging. **Portfolio hedging** attempts to use futures to offset at least some losses during market downswings. In this lesson, we’ll review a sample investing plan for hedging a long stock portfolio and explore different ways to set up and manage a hedge.

### How Hedging Works

A hedge is designed to minimize losses by reducing risk in a portfolio. Many traders reduce risk by allocating between stocks, bonds, and other assets classes, as well as diversifying stock holdings across sectors. However, asset allocation and diversification do not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.

Hedging attempts to be more precise by using a single investment—like a futures contract—to offset losses during specific events. Used correctly, a hedge moves in the opposite direction of the portfolio; therefore, if the portfolio is declining in value, the hedge should be rising in value. This is how losses are offset by hedging. Futures can be a good tool for hedging because their leverage allows traders to offset a large portfolio with a relatively small capital requirement. Depending on the number of contracts traded, you could offset a portion of the portfolio or the entire amount.

Imagine, for example, that you have a $750,000 stock portfolio, and you’re worried an upcoming economic announcement could result in a short-term market downswing. So, you decide to sell one near-term E-Mini S&P 500 equity futures (/ES) contract. If the index falls, you can buy back the contract at a lower price than you sold it for and have a small profit to offset some of the losses in your stock portfolio. The /ES has a multiplier of $50, so if the price of the /ES is 2,600, its notional value is $130,000 ($50 x 2,600).

When you compare the notional value of your futures contract to your portfolio value, you’ve hedged approximately 17% of the stock portfolio.

What if you sold two /ES contracts instead of one, and the S&P 500 fell 50 points? The example account would now be worth approximately $740,500. Let’s break down how this happened. First, we’re assuming the stock portion of the portfolio, all things being equal, fell nearly the same amount as the S&P 500 and would now be worth $735,500 for a loss of $14,500.

Second, the hedge would increase in value by $5,000 (50 points x $50 multiplier x 2 contracts), bringing the total value of the account to $740,500. (For the sake of simplicity, this does not include commissions and fees.)

Without the hedge, the portfolio would have a loss of 1.93% ($750,000 – $735,500 = $14,500/$750,000). With the hedge, the portfolio lost only 1.27% ($750,000 – $740,500 = $9,500/$750,000). The hedge reduced the total loss of the portfolio by lowering the portfolio’s risk.

Please note that these figures are approximations based on the value of the S&P 500, which is often used as a benchmark of the market. In a real trading environment, these values could vary based on different investment selections and individual needs.

### Risks of Hedging

Of course, if the market had gone up instead of down, the hedge would’ve dragged on the portfolio instead. The stock portfolio’s gains would’ve been reduced by the loss on the futures contracts. So, if the S&P 500 had increased by 50 points instead, the stock portfolio would’ve been dragged down by the losses in the hedge, reducing the gains by $5,000. This means that instead of earning $14,500, the portfolio would’ve only earned $9,500. Hedging requires market timing—you must determine when to put on the hedge and when to take it off; losses can potentially be greater than $5,000 if you don’t manage the position and close the hedge.

A hedging investing plan should define which futures contract to use, when to put the hedge on, the size of the hedge, and when to take the hedge off. We’ll look at these elements throughout this lesson.
