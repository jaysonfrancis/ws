### Portfolio Hedging

Now that we’ve covered some of the basics of futures, let’s explore one way to start using futures in a portfolio—hedging. **Portfolio hedging** attempts to use futures to offset at least some losses during market downswings. In this lesson, we’ll review a sample investing plan for hedging a long stock portfolio and explore different ways to set up and manage a hedge.

### How Hedging Works

A hedge is designed to minimize losses by reducing risk in a portfolio. Many traders reduce risk by allocating between stocks, bonds, and other assets classes, as well as diversifying stock holdings across sectors. However, asset allocation and diversification do not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.

Hedging attempts to be more precise by using a single investment—like a futures contract—to offset losses during specific events. Used correctly, a hedge moves in the opposite direction of the portfolio; therefore, if the portfolio is declining in value, the hedge should be rising in value. This is how losses are offset by hedging. Futures can be a good tool for hedging because their leverage allows traders to offset a large portfolio with a relatively small capital requirement. Depending on the number of contracts traded, you could offset a portion of the portfolio or the entire amount.
