#### Options Pricing

Now, let’s figure out how options are priced. By this point, this should be clear: options pricing is more complicated than stocks. There are several factors that impact how an option is priced. The three most important are the price of the underlying, time to expiration, and implied volatility.

It’s important for option traders to understand options pricing—after all, if you don’t know how your trade might make or lose money, how can you describe your results as anything but luck? We’ll begin our investigation into options pricing by examining its history, and then we’ll get into the specifics.

Back in the early days of options trading, options were priced by supply and demand, just as they are today. However, back then, nobody understood why options were priced the way they were. They weren’t able to make a lot of sense of it, and instead, thought it was just a result of market forces.

For example, the underlying stock might go up from $40 to $42, causing a small move in the options price.

Then, the stock might make another $2 move, only this time, the options price moved more than it did before. How would one explain or plan for this inconsistency?

These inconsistencies led to more questions. For example, how would you know how many options to buy to hedge a position? Or, how would you identify a fair price? Perhaps most importantly, how would you determine which factors mattered to the options price? For example, if the stock market crashed, would that have an impact? How about a stock’s recent volatility—would that impact the options price?

These questions help illustrate the issues surrounding options pricing. Traders knew that options could be a useful security, but it was difficult to know whether they were offered at a fair price or how many should be traded to achieve a desired level of risk. For this reason, many viewed options trading as something akin to gambling.

Enter two economists, Fischer Black and Myron Scholes, who published a paper in 1973 with an equation that estimates the price of an option over time. Fittingly, this equation is now known as the Black-Scholes formula, and it describes the relationship between the factors that impact the options price. Essentially, it created a mathematical model for how options pricing works and, in doing so, legitimized options trading. What was once seen by some as gambling, now was given a seat at the table of high finance. Black, Scholes, and another economist, Robert Merton, won a Nobel prize in the ‘90s for their work on options pricing. As you can see, this formula looks pretty complicated.

However, understanding this formula isn’t necessary to trade options. You just need to understand that this formula helped identify which variables were the main drivers of the options price: the price of the underlying, time to expiration, and implied volatility.

Let’s discuss each of these factors, beginning with the **price of the underlying**. Price is often the factor that makes up the majority of an options premium. This makes sense when you consider the leverage inherent to options. Because options allow you to control a large amount of stock (specifically, 100 shares per standard contract), the price of the underlying stock has a big impact on the options price. As you might expect, an option for a stock that’s priced at $10 per share is significantly less than an option for a stock priced at $700 per share.

Another thing to note about changes in price is that its impact on an options premium isn’t linear. For example, the underlying stock may move $1 and you may see the options premium increase $0.30. Then the underlying stock may move $1 more, and you may see the options premium increase $0.38. This non-linear relationship is common to all aspects of options pricing and, as you’ll learn, can be a valuable tool for certain strategies. Later in this lesson, we’ll introduce additional concepts that will help you identify specifically how much an options premium might change depending on changes in various factors.

Now, let’s examine the next factor that makes up the options premium:  **time**. All options have an expiration date. The amount of time left until expiration is the time value of an option. Options with many months until expiration have a lot of time value, while options with only a few days until expiration have little time value. This is because more time to expiration means more time for the option to possibly become profitable—for which the market is willing to pay more. Time value slowly erodes every minute of an options contract’s life (including weekends). This is often referred to as time decay, which describes the way time value melts as an option nears expiration. Time value doesn’t melt at a steady rate either; it melts faster the closer it gets to expiration.
