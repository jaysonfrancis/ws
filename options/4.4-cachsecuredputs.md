#### Cach-Secured Puts

Now, let’s move on to the next income-based options strategy: cash-secured puts. There are a couple different ways option traders use this strategy. Some traders use it to generate income, hoping the option will expire worthless. And other traders use it to build a stock position at a relative discount.

If the put expires OTM, you keep all the premium. If the put goes ITM any time prior to or at expiration, you’ll likely be assigned and are obligated to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price. Traders manage the risk of assignment by  **holding enough cash in their accounts**  to purchase the shares if assigned.

The construction is simple and has two parts. First, you hold  **sufficient cash**  in your account to buy the shares at the strike price if the option is exercised. Like the long stock in a covered call, the cash is there to cover the obligation in the event of assignment. Next, you  **sell a put**. This allows you to collect income in the form of premium.

This strategy is  **bullish** on the underlying stock. After all, if you weren’t bullish on the stock, you likely wouldn’t want to risk being assigned and end up owning it.

If you examine the risk profile for a cash-secured put, you’ll notice that it’s very similar to a risk profile for a covered call.

The  **maximum gain**  for the protective put is the premium received from selling the put. Unlike a covered call, there’s no potential for additional price appreciation since you don’t yet own the stock. The  **maximum loss**, however, is limited but significant—it’s comparable to owning the underlying stock. The  **break-even point**  for this strategy is equal to the strike price minus the premium.

Let’s look at an example. Suppose XYZ is currently trading at $100. You decide this is a stock you’d like to own, and you’re willing to pay $98 per share for it, so you sell a 98 put for $2.

Say the stock plummets to $90. Since your option is  **in the money**, you’d likely be assigned and be obligated to buy shares at $98 when they’re only worth $90 per share. In other words, if you sold one contract, you’d have to pay $9,800 for something worth $9,000. Yikes. The good news—you have the cash available in your account. You’re also slightly better off having sold a put than buying the stock outright because the $200 premium offsets some of the loss. Keep in mind that there is the risk of the stock price continuing to fall below $90.

Say, however, the stock never drops below $98 and closes at $103 at expiration. Since your option is  **out of the money**, it expires worthless and you keep the premium of $200. The downside here is that you missed the chance to buy a stock you want and missed out on some gains you could’ve achieved if you’d bought the stock instead. This is one of the trade-offs to consider when using this strategy.

If you want to enter a stock position, the ideal situation is for the stock to drop just below the strike at expiration—to $97.95 for example. Since your option is  **in the money**  at expiration, you’ll be assigned and buy 100 shares at the desirable price of $98. Because you are now long stock, the best case after this is to then have the stock rally. Because you also receive the premium for selling the short call, you essentially get to purchase the shares at a discount. In other words, because you sold one put, your net spending for the 100 shares would be $9,600 for a $9,795 market value ($9,800 [strike price] – $200 [short call premium]).

The break-even point for this example is $96 ($98 – $2). If the stock rises higher than this, you make money by keeping the premium you received. If it falls lower, you are losing money. If, for example, the stock fell to $95 at expiration, you’d be paying $9,600 ($9,800 – $200) for a $9,500 value. The difference between the market price and the strike price is more than the premium can offset.

The potential benefits of this strategy are **generating income** or  **lowering your net cost** to enter a stock position. But the risks, as you’ve seen, include  **paying a higher price**  for a stock,  **missing out**  on the stock appreciation if the stock rallies, or the risk of purchasing the stock at the strike price and having the  **stock** **fall**.

This strategy is often used by option traders looking to generate income, or investors looking to scale in to a position. These investors should be willing to be a little more active than the typical buy-and-hold investor and open to the additional risk inherent in selling options.
