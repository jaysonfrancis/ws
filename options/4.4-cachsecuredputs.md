#### Cach-Secured Puts

Now, let’s move on to the next income-based options strategy: cash-secured puts. There are a couple different ways option traders use this strategy. Some traders use it to generate income, hoping the option will expire worthless. And other traders use it to build a stock position at a relative discount.

If the put expires OTM, you keep all the premium. If the put goes ITM any time prior to or at expiration, you’ll likely be assigned and are obligated to buy 100 shares of stock at the strike price. Traders manage the risk of assignment by  **holding enough cash in their accounts**  to purchase the shares if assigned.

The construction is simple and has two parts. First, you hold  **sufficient cash**  in your account to buy the shares at the strike price if the option is exercised. Like the long stock in a covered call, the cash is there to cover the obligation in the event of assignment. Next, you  **sell a put**. This allows you to collect income in the form of premium.
