#### Covered Calls and Cash-Secured Puts Options Greeks

Okay—we’ve taken a closer look at covered calls and cash-secured puts. Let’s talk through the impact that price, time, and implied volatility have on these strategies. By understanding the degree of impact these three factors have on these strategies, you’ll better understand why your trades gain or lose value over their lifetime.

Delta’s always a good place to start. These two strategies are  **delta-positive**, which means increases in the underlying lead to higher potential profits.

Remember, delta measures the impact of price movement on the premium, and for these strategies, it’s the  **biggest driver** of profitability. That said, delta’s influence is  **capped at the strike price**.

For example, if you buy stock at $42 per share and sell a 45 call, the stock can rise all the way to $45 and you’ll continue to make money. But if the stock rises to $46, you’ll still make the same amount of money as if the stock just rose to $45. In other words, it doesn’t matter how much the price moves beyond the strike, you won’t make any more money on the position. You can see this on the risk profile, as the line plateaus at the strike.

**Covered calls and cash-secured puts have limited upside potential**.

It’s important to note that, once the strike price is reached, your stock position will continue to gain in value if the price increases. However, these gains are offset by losses in the short call. When you put these two positions together, your net profit is equal to the max gain, or the total premium plus any gains in the underlying up to the strike price.

Covered calls and cash-secured puts are  **gamma-negative**.

This is another way of saying that delta has less influence as the underlying price goes up because of the capped maximum gain. Basically, gamma chips away at delta until it plateaus at the strike. This is clear when you examine the risk profile of a trade that’s  _not_  at expiration. As you can see in the risk profile below, the line smoothly curves from a 45-degree angle to the plateau. This deceleration of profits is gamma in action.
