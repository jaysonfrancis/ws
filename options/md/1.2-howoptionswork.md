#### How Options Work

Now it’s time to dig in to what an options contract is. Let’s start with a basic definition.

An  **options contract**  is a derivative investment that gives the owner of the contract the right to buy or sell a specified number of shares of a stock, ETF, or another predetermined underlying at a certain price before a certain date.

There's a lot in that definition. To make things clearer, let’s walk through an example. Let’s say it’s June and XYZ stock is currently trading at $49 per share.

Trader A thinks XYZ will go up in value in the next month, and Trader B thinks it’ll go down.

Trader A could simply buy the stock, but she’s not interested in building a position. So she decides to use options to speculate on bullish price movement without owning the stock.

Options are  **derivatives**, which means their value is derived from the value of something else. In particular, the options price is derived from an underlying.

Options are also leveraged instruments, which means investors can potentially earn higher returns or experience greater losses using relatively small amounts of capital. Therefore, options can be an alternative way for Trader A to speculate on the price movement of a security. Now, back to the example.

So, Trader A buys an options contract from Trader B that gives her  **the right to buy**  XYZ at a certain price, known as the  **strike price**, and before a certain date, known as the **expiration**. The strike price and the expiration are specified in the contract. This particular contract has a strike price of $50 and expires in July (one month).

In exchange for that right, Trader A pays Trader B a  **premium** (options lingo for “price”), which for this XYZ option is $2. A standard options contract controls 100 shares of the underlying. The total amount an investor has to pay for a single options contract equals the price of the option ($2) times the options multiplier (100), or $200 plus transaction costs (contract fees). So Trader A pays Trader B $200 to buy one options contract. It’s important to understand that Trader A hasn’t actually bought any shares of XYZ yet—she has only bought the  _right_  to buy.

For Trader A to have the right to buy XYZ at the strike price, someone must be willing to sell at that price. That’s where Trader B, or the option seller, comes in. Trader B collects the $200 in exchange for promising to sell XYZ at $50 any time between now and the expiration date in July. Basically, she’s  **obligated to sell**  if Trader A exercises her right to buy before expiration.

Notice the difference: the  **buyer has the right**  to buy, and the  **seller has the obligation**  to sell. Trader A doesn’t have to exercise her right. If she doesn’t, Trader B won’t be obligated to sell. But if Trader A does exercise her right, Trader B must fulfill her end of the deal. Note that this is a simplified explanation—usually, a market maker mediates the buyer and seller relationship, but we’ll get into this a little later.

Now this may seem a little strange—why would the right to buy have value? Or, why would the seller be compensated for taking on this obligation? Well, to help clear this up, let’s look at some possible outcomes of our example.

Let’s assume that before the options contract expires, the price of XYZ jumps from $49 to $53. Trader A could exercise her right and buy 100 shares from Trader B at the strike price—a much more desirable price of $50. Therefore, this right allows Trader A the ability to purchase a stock for  _less_  than its current market price. In this circumstance, it’s easy to see why Trader A would be willing to pay $200 for the XYZ option. We can all appreciate the value of paying less for something that’s more expensive.

On the other hand, let’s suppose that XYZ falls from $49 to $48 before the options contract expires. Trader A could still exercise her right to buy at $50, but why would she want to pay more for something she could buy on the market for cheaper? In this situation, the XYZ option would likely go unexercised and expire worthless, leaving Trader A out her $200.

Now, let’s look at it from the seller’s perspective. In both cases, Trader B keeps the $200 premium she received for selling the option, no matter what. However, if the stock price is higher than the strike price at expiration, the seller will likely have to sell the stock (called assignment) for less than it’s worth. If the seller didn’t already own the stock, she would need to buy the stock in order to deliver. She would then lose the difference between the strike and the market price, which would cut into her $200 profit. This would be a less-than-ideal outcome for Trader B. Therefore, the seller hopes that the contract expires worthless because she’d keep the full premium.

This example shows what would’ve happened if Trader A wanted to exercise her right to buy—a process known as  **exercising the option**—and waited until expiration to do so. But that’s only one possible outcome of an options trade. Many traders buy and sell options contracts long before expiration without ever intending to exercise their right to the underlying. Keep in mind there is no guarantee of being able to close an options position, as there are circumstances where the quote on an options contract can actually be zero.

**Options contracts fluctuate in value**  and can often be bought or sold before expiration for a profit or loss. Remember the premium we introduced earlier? Like a stock price, that premium is constantly changing in value, and as it changes, your options contract becomes more or less valuable. Because our examples focused on the value of the options premium at expiration, options pricing may seem pretty simple. However, pricing is more complex when you consider how it would gain or lose when it’s days, weeks, or months from expiration. This is a very important thing to understand about options—**options pricing**  is different than stock pricing. A stock’s value only comes down to one factor—its price. The options premium, however, is influenced by multiple factors—the value of the underlying stock, of course, but also things like how much time is left until expiration and the perceived risk of the underlying, also known as implied volatility.

Let’s go back to our example to illustrate. Suppose that a week into the trade, the price of the underlying stock spiked, say from $49 to $52. With each dollar that price goes up, the value of the option increases. Let’s assume by the time the underlying stock reached $52, the option increased from $200 to $250 per contract. Trader A now holds an options contract that’s worth a lot more than it was when she bought it. She could sell this contract to someone else and profit from the price appreciation. She’d be buying low and selling high.

Conversely, if the premium fell from $200 to $150 per contract, Trader B could buy the contract back at this lower price, capturing the $50 difference. This would be a case of selling high, then buying low.

It’s important to keep in mind that a little price move in the underlying can result in a big percentage move in the options premium. And a big move in the underlying can result in an even bigger percentage move in the options premium. This is  **leverage** at work. Using a relatively small amount of capital to control a much larger amount of the underlying security magnifies both gains and losses. Leverage can be a benefit if the trade goes your way, but a burden if it doesn’t. Leverage is the chief reason why options are risky.

Whenever entering a trade, it’s important to consider the potential risks, returns, and your probability of success. You should always know what you stand to lose and be willing to accept it.

If your head’s starting to spin, don’t worry—we’ll revisit all of these ideas later. But at this point, you’ve been introduced to many of the core concepts. Over the next two lessons, we’ll expand on these, reinforce key points, and fill in all the important details.
