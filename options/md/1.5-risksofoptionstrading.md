#### Risks of Options Trading

While options trading has significant benefits, it also has significant risks. Every option trader needs a solid understanding of what these risks are and how they can impact their trading.

The most basic risk of buying options is the chance that they may expire worthless. This makes options radically different from stocks. While some stocks have certainly lost so much value that they literally fell to zero, this is an unusual event in the stock market. Options commonly expire worthless, and ultimately, all options expire.

Next is a concept you’re familiar with:  **leverage**. In the options world, leverage means using a little money to control a large amount of the underlying security (compared to buying the underlying directly).

When the amount you’re investing is equal or similar to the amount you’re putting at risk, risk is a little easier to conceptualize. But when leverage is involved, it can be easy for investors to focus on the potential benefits rather than the risks. If a leveraged trade goes against you and you haven’t properly managed risk, you can blow up your account. This is trader-speak for taking your account balance to zero.

When you combine the leverage of options with their sophistication, it can lead to a get-rich quick mentality. Many beginning option traders are prone to “what if” thinking: “What if I bought this long-shot trade and a big move happened?” With leveraged investments, it’s more important than ever to understand and carefully manage your risk while focusing on the real probabilities of success in a given trade.

Another risk is the risk associated with  **margin trading**. Some options are traded in margin accounts, which are accounts where the broker lends the trader money to make purchases or lends securities to make sales. These loans are secured by cash or the investments in a trader’s account.

**In a margin account, a broker loans you funds to invest**.

There’s also the risk of  **oversimplification**. One common mistake new option traders make is to underestimate the complexity of options and focus on just one factor, like price. Options trading is complex—if you think you can master it and outsmart the market quickly, you’re probably in for a rude awakening. But through education and experience, you can make sense of the complexity and learn how to trade options with confidence.

Another risk related to options is  **overtrading**, or excessively buying and selling options contracts. Like any type of trading, options trading involves contract fees. These fees can have a significant impact on your account. When it comes to options trading, these fees generally include a commission fee or service charge, an additional per-contract fee, and often exercise and assignment fees. Additionally, while it technically isn’t a fee, the bid/ask spread is also an important consideration related to overtrading. The bid/ask spread is the distance between the bid price (the best price buyers are willing to take, where a market sell order would fill) and the ask price (the best price sellers are willing to take, where a market buy order would fill). It has a larger impact on options trading than it does on stocks and is therefore very important to consider in your trading. If you trade options with wider spreads, they’ll impact your returns. If you trade these kind of options frequently, the amount that it cuts into your returns will be greater. Later in this course, we’ll teach you how to identify options with more favorable bid/ask spreads.

Let’s look at one more risk:  **exercise and assignment risk**. Assignment is what happens to the option seller when the option buyer exercises the contract. When you’re assigned, you’re also obligated to fulfill the contract and, depending on the type of contract, either buy or sell shares at a specified price.

Similarly, if you’re an option buyer and hold an option that  **expires with a value of $0.01 or more**, the option will be automatically exercised. The outcome here is similar to assignment—you’ll buy or sell shares of the underlying stock and be charged an exercise fee (which, again, will likely be higher than standard transaction fees).

If, as a put option seller, you’re obligated to buy shares, you may end up holding shares you didn’t plan to buy. This obligation ties up capital and could lead to unexpected losses if the stock drops before you have time to close the position. If you don’t have enough capital to purchase the shares when assignment happens, you’d likely be forced to sell the stock at a loss.

If, as a call option seller, you’re obligated to sell shares, you may end up selling shares before you wanted to and miss out on any additional appreciation. By selling the shares, you lose the stock position.

Although the risks associated with assignment and expiration can never be eliminated, you’ll learn ways to manage the risk when we introduce specific strategies.

Clearly, options are risky and not for everyone. That’s why, if you’re considering adding options to your portfolio, it’s so important to educate yourself, learn about what options are and how they work, and practice paper trading options before risking real capital. By taking this course and educating yourself, you can learn to trade options with confidence.
