#### Benefits of Options Trading

We’ve already introduced some benefits of options trading. Now, let’s explore these benefits and risks in more detail.

One of the most important benefits of options trading is the potential to  **enhance your portfolio returns**. This can be pursued in a few ways. Some traders might attempt to generate returns on speculative trades, but more typically they might sell options in an attempt to generate income.

Additionally, other traders might hedge certain positions during certain market conditions, or use options to buy or sell a stock or ETF position at a more desirable price.

When options are used in any of these ways successfully, you have the potential to enhance your overall returns.

Another important benefit is the ability to  **manage the amount of risk in your portfolio**. Managing risk is critical—traders are always trying to achieve that sweet spot where they can maximize their potential returns for a given amount of risk. Options can be used to manage the risk of a single position or an entire portfolio.

Options can also be used to  **buy or sell shares in an underlying position**, potentially at a more desirable price. We’ll cover the details of how this works in the next few lessons, but here’s the gist. If you were planning on buying or selling a stock, you could sell an option, allowing you to collect some premium. Then, if the trade went as planned and the option was assigned, you’d be obligated to buy or sell the stock at the strike price, which could be more favorable than the prior market price. Additionally, the premium you collected could help lower your overall cost for the position.

**Example of how options can be used to attempt to lower net cost when buying stock**.

To wrap up our discussion of benefits, let’s return to one of the first benefits you learned about options: their  **flexibility**. Options are highly customizable and versatile, whether you’re looking for a specific risk/return, probability, or direction. With education and practice, savvy option traders can create strategies that fit their own investing style.
