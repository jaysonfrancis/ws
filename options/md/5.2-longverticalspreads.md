#### Long Vertical Spreads

There are multiple types of spreads, but in this lesson we’re going to focus on vertical spreads, starting with long vertical spreads. A **long vertical** is when you:

- **(1)** purchase one option, then 
- **(2)** sell another option with the same expiration but **further out of the money (OTM)** to lower the cost of the long position and limit risk.

When trading long vertical spreads, the **long option is the driver**, or in other words, the position which drives the profit. It may help to think of long vertical spreads as if you’re simply buying a long call or a long put. It’s a way to speculate on the movement of the underlying, while managing some risk.

There are two types of long verticals: 
- 1. **long call verticals** 
- 2. **long put verticals**. These strategies are similar, although they have slightly different constructions and biases. A long call vertical is constructed with call options and is typically short-term bullish, while a long put vertical is constructed with put options and is typically short-term bearish.

During this lesson, we’ll use  **long call verticals**  to illustrate and explain long verticals. And we’ll point out critical differences with **long put verticals**.

As we mentioned, long call verticals are a bullish strategy—option traders often use these when they have a neutral or bullish outlook on the underlying.

**Components of a long call vertical and their biases**

Let’s talk through the construction of this strategy in a little more detail. First, you  **buy a call**  for a debit. The purpose of this option is to speculate on the underlying. However, depending on which call you buy, your option would likely be some mix of intrinsic and extrinsic value. The extrinsic value creates two obstacles to your success. 

- (1) First, you need the  **price to move up**  high enough to **compensate** for the extrinsic value before you can make a profit. 
- (2) Second, extrinsic value melts away every day because of  **time decay**. 

To help manage these risks, you  **sell an option** that’s higher or further out of the money. The premium or credit collected from this position lowers the total cost of the trade, which means you don’t need as big of a move in the underlying to break even. And because the short OTM position is entirely extrinsic value, it offsets some, if not all, of the loss of value in the long option due to time decay.

Now, let’s look at the long call vertical  **risk profile**  and discuss its risk and return. Notice the two horizontal lines. These illustrate the defined risk and return. 

- The  **maximum loss** is the net premium paid, or the net debit, on the trade. 
- The  **maximum gain** is the difference between the two strikes minus the net premium. 
- The strategy  **breaks even** at the long call strike plus the net premium.

To make this more concrete, let’s walk through an example. Say FAMB is currently trading at $58 and Trader A is bullish, so
 
- (1) she **buys** a 60 strike call for $3. 
 
*To reduce the cost and manage the risk, she:*

- (2) **sells** a 64 strike call for $0.85. 

Her net debit for the spread is **$2.15** ($3.00 – $0.85).

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.20.06.jpg)

Now, let’s say the stock closes at $65 at expiration. In this case, both options would be **in the money.** The short call would likely be assigned, requiring Trader A to sell 100 shares at $64 per share. At the same time, Trader A could exercise the long call and buy 100 shares at $60 per share. This would yield a $4-per-share profit. **After subtracting the $2.15 debit** from the spread, Trader A would have a **total profit of $1.85 per share**, not including transaction fees. This is the ideal outcome for this strategy—no matter how much higher the stock goes, the gain will be capped at $1.85 per share.

- **Short call assigned**: sells 100 shares at $64.
- **Exercise long call**: buy 100 shares at $60.
- ($64 - $60) = $4-per-share profit.
- Subtract the $2.15 debit from the spread.
- ($4 - $2.15) = **Total profit of $1.85 per share**

Instead, let’s say the stock stays flat and closes at $58 at expiration. In this case, both options would be out of the money and would expire worthless. The **total loss** on the trade would be the **net debit of $2.15**, not including transaction fees. This is the worst potential outcome; the loss is capped here.

Finally, let’s look at what happens if the stock closes between the two strikes at expiration, at $62 for example. In this case, the long option would be in the money with $2 of intrinsic value, and the short option would be out of the money and expire worthless. The break-even point for this trade is $62.15 (calculated by adding $2.15 [net debit] to $60 [long call strike]). Trader A would lose $0.15 per share on the trade, not including transaction fees—the $0.15 is remaining extrinsic value that wasn’t offset by the short call or the underlying’s move.

- net debit of $2.15
- long option has $2 of intrinsic value.
- short option expires worthless.
- total loss of $0.15 per share

With that understanding of long call verticals, let’s quickly review  **long put verticals**. As you know, this is a bearish strategy when traders buy a put to speculate on the underlying, then sell a put lower or further out of the money to reduce the cost and manage risk. As with the long call vertical, the driver of the trade is the long put, and the spread results in a net debit.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.20.10.jpg)

The risk profile of the long put vertical spread is the inverse of the long call vertical spread. 

Like the long call vertical, the  **maximum gain**  is the difference between the strikes minus the net debit—however, this is achieved when the underlying price decreases. 

The  **maximum loss**  is the net debit on the trade, which is achieved when the underlying price increases. 

The  **break-even point**  is the long strike minus the net debit.

One of the benefits of long verticals is that the **(+)** underlying doesn’t have to move as much for the trade to be profitable. That said, one risk with long verticals is that **(-)** you’re subject to time decay, or “on the clock,” so the underlying **needs** to move some. 

The short option may reduce the time decay risk, but it doesn’t eliminate the risk that the underlying won’t move before expiration.

As you’ve seen long vertical spreads reduce the cost and risk of the single long options position but also reduce the potential profit. They’re still speculative investments and should be used by traders who understand and can withstand the risks and how the strategy works.
