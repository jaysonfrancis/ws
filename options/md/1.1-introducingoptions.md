#### Introducing Options

Options are a challenging and exciting asset class. Options can be used to pursue a number of goals. An investor may use options to potentially generate additional income or hedge a stock position. Meanwhile, a trader may use options for speculation.

Learning about and trading options has its hurdles. Options trading involves significant risks and is not suitable for everyone. Some of the more complex strategies can carry substantial risk. In addition, options are a decaying asset that lose value over time and ultimately expire. And since options are derivative securities, the trading and pricing of options is inherently more complicated than stocks. This combination of complexity and risk can leave many investors confused or unprepared for the realities of options trading. However, this course is different from other options education. Here, we’ll tackle the core concepts to make sure you’re confident and prepared. Then, we’ll introduce a variety of options strategies and demonstrate how those strategies work.

So, considering the hurdles and risks, why use options? There are several reasons. First, options can be used to help **manage risk**  (by serving as a hedge) or to take on a little or a lot more risk (by incorporating income or speculative strategies).

**Options can be traded when you think the price is moving up or moving down**.

This management of risk is what allows options to have many different uses. Options are generally used for three main purposes: to  **generate income**, to  **speculate**, and to  **hedge**. We’ll talk more about each of these purposes, but this course focuses mainly on strategies geared toward the goal of generating income. These strategies typically allow you to define your level of risk and return.

Next, like some other securities, options can also be used to place  **bullish**,  **bearish**, or even  **neutral**  trades. Therefore, options can be traded in all kinds of market conditions. Additionally, options can allow you to speculate on more than just changes in price—you can also speculate on changes in other factors like time and implied volatility (more on this later).

**Options can be traded when price is moving up and when it’s moving down**.

Another important feature is that options strategies are  **highly versatile**. There are a wide variety of strategies, each with its own risk/return ratio. For example, some strategies have very high risk and high return potential, while others have limited risk and limited return potential.

Likewise, traders can also customize these strategies to determine a  **probability of success**  that’s right for them. As you might expect, strategies with high probabilities of success tend to have low potential returns, and strategies with low probabilities of success tend to have high potential returns. However, there is a wide variety of customization that can be done to create a balance that could meet your own needs.

**Because of their versatility, you can create options trades with varying risks, potential returns, and probabilities of success**.

Different traders use options for different purposes. But whatever they’re used for,  **options are an active trading strategy**. Because options have a built-in expiration and can be very risky, they should not be considered a passive investment.
