#### Short Verticals

Now, let’s explore another spread strategy: short verticals. In a short vertical, **you sell one option**, which generates income, and **buy another option further out of the money**, which can help manage risk.

There are two types of short verticals: short call verticals and short put verticals. These two strategies are very similar, except one is constructed with calls and is bearish (short call vertical) and one is constructed with puts and is bullish (short put vertical).

Because short call verticals and short put verticals are so similar, for most of this page we’ll focus on  **short call verticals**. Then at the end we’ll compare and contrast short call verticals and short put verticals.

Short call verticals are often used by option traders who have a  **short-term**  **bearish** outlook on the underlying. However, this strategy can be profitable when the underlying trends sideways as well.

**Components of a short call vertical and their biases**

Let’s look at how a short call vertical is constructed in more detail. This strategy has two parts, but when you enter the trade, you’ll open both contracts at the same time. The first part of the trade is  **selling a call**. The purpose of this option is to generate income (also described as a credit), just as a short call does in a covered call trade. If the strategy stopped here, you’d have a naked call—a very risky position, as you’d be on the hook to sell shares of the underlying even if it moved very unfavorably. This is where the second option comes in. The second part of the trade is there to manage risk. You’ll do this by  **buying a call** at a higher strike that is further out of the money. Though you have to pay premium for this position (also described as a debit), which lowers the trade’s potential net profit, the long call is usually cheaper than the short call because it’s further out of the money. So, when you combine the two options, the result is a net credit.

To help illustrate how the long call can help manage risk, let’s consider what happens if the trade moves against you. Suppose XYZ has been downtrending and is currently trading at $99. You think it’s going to continue its decline, so you sell a call with a 100 strike and buy another call further out of the money at the 102 strike to manage risk.

Now, assume the stock changes course and rallies. At expiration, it’s trading in the money at $105. As a result, your short call will be assigned, and you’ll be on the hook to sell 100 shares of a stock you don’t own for $100 per share—$5 per share less than it’s currently trading. This would add up to a $500 loss. However, you bought a long call to manage risk. Because of this, when the short call is assigned, the long call would be automatically exercised at the 102 strike, fulfilling your obligation of the short call. As a result, instead of losing $500 on the trade, your loss is limited to the distance between the two strikes—$2, or $200 for the whole contract. And we haven’t yet factored in the premium received from selling the spread, which would help further reduce losses. Of course, you also have to factor in the exercise and assignment fees you would incur as well.

In a sense, the long call fulfills the same role as the long stock in a covered call—if you’re assigned, the long call helps you fulfill your obligation. However, one important difference between long stock and long calls is the cost of each. The amount to buy a long call is typically less than the cost of owning 100 shares of the underlying stock. This is one of the main benefits of selling a short vertical over a covered call or cash-secured put—it’s a more  **capital-efficient**  way to potentially generate income.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.60.07.jpg)

Therefore, if you had no interest in investing in the underlying but wanted to generate income and speculate on the direction the underlying is moving, short vertical trades might be right for you.

To get a better sense of the potential risk and return for this strategy, let’s look at its risk profile. Notice the two plateaus—this strategy has limited potential gains and losses. 

1. **maximum gain** is the net credit, or the difference between the two premiums.  
2.  **maximum loss** is the difference between the two strikes minus the net credit.


![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.60.08.jpg)

This is an important point to remember when selecting your strikes—the greater the distance between them, the greater your exposure to risk. At the same time, the further out of the money your long put is, the cheaper it’ll be and the larger your potential profit. It’s a trade-off.

With its limited risk, this strategy has a lower risk than if you owned the underlying, such as in a covered call trade. This strategy’s  **break-even point**  is equal to the short call strike plus the net credit.

Let’s talk through an example where FAMB is currently trading at $30. Your short-term outlook is bearish, so you sell a 32 call for $1.50. Because this option is out of the money, at this point, the probability is greater that this option could expire worthless. To manage the risk, you buy a 35 call for $0.60 at the same time. With these two options combined, your net credit for the spread is $0.90 ($1.50 – $0.60) or $90 total credit received, less transaction costs.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.60.09.jpg)

Say the stock rises to $31 at expiration. Since it’s still below both strikes, both options are  **out of the money**  and expire worthless, leaving you with the $90 credit you collected from selling the spread, not including transaction fees. This is the ideal outcome for this strategy—it’s how you achieve maximum gain.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.60.10.jpg)

On the other hand, say the stock closes at $33 at expiration. Now, your short call is  **in the money**, but your long call is still  **out of the money**. When the stock ends up between your two strikes, you’re in a bit of a pickle. You’d be assigned on the short call; however, you wouldn’t want to exercise your OTM long call to fulfill your obligations as it would cause you to incur the max loss.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.60.11.jpg)

Instead, you’d need to have enough capital to buy the shares at the current market price and sell them back at the strike price for a loss of $100 ([$33 – $32] x 100). However, when you factor in the amount you received for selling the short call vertical, the trade’s total outcome would be a loss of $10 ($90 premium – $100 loss on the outcome of the short call) plus transaction costs.

When the price closes between the two spreads, it can be capital-intensive to buy the shares at the market value and sell them back at your strike. To avoid this situation, it’s typically better to close the trade by buying back the short call before expiration.

Finally, say the stock closes at $37 at expiration, leaving both options  **ITM**. As you likely know by now, the obligation of the short call would be fulfilled by the long call, which is automatically exercised.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.60.12.jpg)

You’d be out the distance between the two strikes ($3 per share, or $300 per single spread) minus the net credit for selling the spread ($90) for a total loss of $210 plus transaction costs. No matter how high the stock rises, this is the most you’ll lose.

In this example, the break-even point is $32.90 ($32.00 + $0.90). At this price, the value of the premium helps offset the loss from the short call.

Now that you’re familiar with short call verticals, let’s take a second to discuss  **short put verticals**. Short put verticals are similar to short call verticals in that you sell one option and purchase another at a different strike to cap the max loss. The difference, of course, is that the driver of a short put vertical is a short put and the hedge is a long put at a lower strike. As a result, the trade has a  **short-term neutral to bullish**  outlook.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_5.60.13.jpg)

As you can see in the risk profile below, the short put vertical is similar to the short call vertical in that it has limited potential gains and losses. 

- 1. **maximum gain** is the net credit, or the difference between the two premiums less transaction costs.  
- 2. **maximum loss** is the difference between the two strikes minus the net credit. 

The change is that the short put vertical profits if the price of the underlying stays put or increases.
