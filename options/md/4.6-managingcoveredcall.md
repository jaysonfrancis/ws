#### Managing a Covered Call

Once you’ve opened a covered call, you should monitor your positions to determine when it’s time for the trade to end or for another trade to begin. Let’s explore the various outcomes of a covered call trade and identify what exit considerations apply to both the call option and the stock. We’ll start with the option.

As the option nears expiration, there are two scenarios: either the option will be  **in the money**  (and at risk of assignment) or  **out of the money**.

The first scenario, the call being in the money, requires a little more decision making on your part. Remember, any time your option is in the money, you’re at risk of assignment. If you’re happy letting the stock go at the strike price, then there is nothing for you to do. You’d simply wait for the option to be assigned, wave goodbye to the shares, pay the assignment fee, and be happy with the premium received from the option. Plus, if you’d sold out an out-of-the-money call, you would’ve had some price gains in the stock as well. Your total profit would be equal to the options premium plus any stock appreciation. Unless the stock really skyrocketed and you missed out on a lot of upside, you can usually be pretty happy with this scenario.

However, if the option is in the money and you’d prefer to keep the shares, there are a few things you can consider. In each case, examine the trade four or more days before expiration to make your decision and avoid assignment—assignment can happen anytime, but the likelihood increases as expiration approaches.

First, you can  **buy back the call contract**. Doing this closes the short call position and allows you to keep the stock shares you own. However, depending on how far your call is in the money, you may have to buy the contract back for more than you received when you sold the contract. This would result in a loss on the options trade.

Another potential outcome is  **rolling the trade**. In the options world, rolling simply means buying back your current option and selling a new one with a later expiration in one transaction. The new option could be either the same strike as your current option or a different strike. When rolling a trade, you enter a new trade, which hopefully would help manage your losses.

For example, suppose your option is only in the money by a few cents. At this point in the trade, maybe it’d cost you $0.45 ($45 per contract) to buy the contract back. However, you notice that a contract with the same strike price expiring in 43 days could be sold for $0.95 ($95 per contract). In this situation, you could buy back the old contract and sell the new contract for a potential net credit of $0.50 ($50 total not including commissions and fees). This is rolling an option. Keep in mind that a rolling strategy will incur additional transaction costs.

What if the option is  **out of the money**? If it’s several days before expiration, you can  **close it out to lock in any profits**  or simply  **wait for it to expire**. When this happens, you keep all of the premium and keep your shares. This is the best of both worlds, assuming the stock hasn’t lost value. Of course, waiting for expiration brings the risk that the stock could suddenly surge and diminish your profit or even result in assignment.

We’ve discussed exit considerations for the call; now let’s look at exits for the stock. With your stock, you should follow the same criteria you typically use for determining when to sell a stock. If these criteria are met, then you might want to close the entire position (both the option  _and_  the stock). If you decide to exit the stock trade, consider exiting the short call trade first so you don’t accidentally enter into a risky uncovered call position.
