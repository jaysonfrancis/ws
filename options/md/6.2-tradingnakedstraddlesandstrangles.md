#### Trading Naked Straddles and Strangles

Now that we’ve discussed single-leg uncovered contracts, let’s look at straddles and strangles. A naked straddle or strangle involves selling a call and a put at the same time. This results in a higher potential return, and since a stock can only go one direction, one side of the trade is likely to be successful. However, the loss on the other side of the trade could easily eat up both premiums. We’ll look at how to construct straddles and strangles, as well as how to determine each strategy’s potential risk and return and probability of success.

A  **short straddle**  consists of selling a naked call and selling a naked put with the  **same strike and expiration**  in order to keep the premium collected from both short positions. The combination of a short put and a short call creates a neutral strategy that relies primarily on time decay to generate a profit.

To help illustrate this, let’s look at the risk profile. Notice how the combination of the short put and short call create a triangle-like shape.

 - 1. **maximum gain**  is achieved at the peak of the triangle—this is equal to the two premiums collected and is only achieved if the stock closes exactly at the strike price at expiration and neither option is exercised. 

Then, there’s a window to the left or right of the strike price where the trade could be profitable until it hits one of two break-even points. The  **break-even point**  for the short put is the strike minus both premiums received. And the break-even point for the short call is the strike plus both premiums received. The  **maximum loss**  is either infinite if the stock rallies to infinity (due to the naked call), or equal to the strike price minus both premiums if the stock falls to zero (due to the naked put).

Let’s walk through an example. Say XYZ is trading at $80. Trader B, hoping price will stay flat, sells a call and a put, each with an 80 strike for a $3 total premium.

First, let’s look at the ideal outcome: if the stock stays flat and closes right at $80 at expiration. In this case, both options would likely expire worthless (although, as you have learned in previous lessons, it’s possible for any at-the-money option to be assigned, and you could end up with an unwanted long or short stock position). Trader B would keep the full premium of $300, not including commissions and fees.

Now, let’s see what happens if the stock were to close at $84 at expiration. In this case, the short put would expire worthless, and the short call would be assigned. Trader B would have to sell shares at the 80 strike, entering a short stock position. He would then have to buy the shares on the next trading day to cover his short position. Assuming Trader B is able to buy the shares at $84 per share, the $3 premium would offset some of the loss for a total loss of $1 per share. This loss would continue to increase infinitely as the stock price increased.

Finally, let’s look at what would happen if the stock closed at $78 at expiration. Here, the short call would expire worthless and the short put would be assigned. Trader B would have to buy shares at the 80 strike, even though those shares are only worth $78. However, in this case, the premium received would offset the difference, essentially allowing Trader B to buy XYZ at an effective price of $77 per share. Assuming Trader B was able to sell the stock position back at $78 per share, he’d profit $100, not including commissions and fees.

A  **short strangle**  consists of selling a call and a put with the  **same expiration but with different strike prices**, again with the goal of keeping premium collected from both options. In a short strangle, the options are usually sold at strikes that are equally out of the money. A put option is sold at a strike price lower than the stock price, while the call option is sold at a strike that is higher than the stock price. Traders often use this strategy when they’re neutral on price movement but want to give the stock price more wiggle room. Of course, wiggle room comes at a cost because the premium received likely won’t be as high for a strangle as it would be for a straddle, though this ultimately has to do with which strikes are chosen.

Take a look at the risk profile—note that this strategy has a much larger window of potential profitability than a short straddle. Additionally, there’s a much larger range of prices where max profit can be achieved. However, like a straddle, there’s also potential for significant losses on either side of this range.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_6.30.08.jpg)

Again, the  **maximum profit**  is limited to the premium received from both options, but in this case, traders need the price to stay within the two strike prices to obtain maximum gain. Like the straddle, the  **maximum loss**  is either infinite if the stock rallies infinitely, or very substantial if the stock falls to zero. The trade  **breaks even** on the downside at the put strike minus any premium received, or breaks even on the upside at the call strike plus any premium received.

Let’s walk through an example. Say XYZ is currently trading at $60. Trader C sells the 65 call and the 55 put for a total premium of $2.10.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_6.30.09.jpg)

Now, let’s say the stock closes at $63 at expiration. Both options would be out of the money and expire worthless, allowing Trader C to keep the full premium, not including commissions and fees. This is the ideal outcome, and it can be achieved if the stock price remains anywhere between the two strikes up until expiration. This demonstrates how this strategy is more forgiving than the straddle, though the premiums are generally lower.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_6.30.10.jpg)

Say, though, that the stock closes at $68 at expiration. In this case, the short call would be in the money and get assigned, while the short put would expire worthless. Trader C would be obligated to sell the shares at the 65 strike price, entering a short position. Then, to cover this position, Trader C would buy the shares at the current price when the market opens on Monday, which may be more or less than $68. Assuming Trader C is able to buy the shares at $68 per share, the premium would offset this loss by $2.10, resulting in a net loss of $0.90 per share. This loss would grow infinitely bigger as the stock price continued to rise. Now, such a big move might be uncommon, but it can happen. You also need to consider your ability to raise enough capital to fulfill your obligations, if assigned. Assuming the stock was purchased at $68 for this example, that amount would be $6,800—you would have to come up with more cash to buy the shares.

Finally, let’s look at what would happen if the stock closed at $54 at expiration. The short call would expire worthless, and the short put would get assigned. Trader C would be required to buy XYZ at $55 when it’s only worth $54. However, this is still above the trade’s break-even point, and the premium would offset the difference, allowing Trader C to effectively purchase shares at $52.90 ($55.00 – $2.10). Taking the trade as a whole, however, consider that Trader C must now come up with $5,290 to buy shares he may not want to own and the price of XYZ could continue to fall. However, assuming Trader C was able to sell the stock position back at $54 per share, he’d profit $110, not including commissions and fees.

You can imagine that it’s impossible to predict the exact price for a stock on a particular day, so why would anyone use these strategies? One benefit is that by selling two options you have twice the time decay benefit because you have twice the contracts. Short straddles and short strangles also have the same capital requirements as a single short option, but they have the potential for greater returns compared to a single short option. Another benefit is that even though you have two open naked options, you only have to margin one side of the trade because the stock can only go one direction. Typically, you margin the side with the larger margin requirement, plus the premium received from the other option.

As with single-leg naked options, traders shouldn’t attempt to trade naked straddles or strangles unless they’re experienced, confident, comfortable with undefined risk, and able to afford big losses.
