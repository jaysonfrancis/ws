#### Setting Up a Long Call Vertical

Now, let’s walk through the decisions involved when actually setting up a long call vertical.

As a quick recap, a long call vertical involves  

- 1) **buying** a call and then  
- 2) **selling** another call further out of the money to reduce the cost. 

Overall, the strategy is bullish, so the ideal condition is a **bullish market**. Since the strategy is driven by a long position, long verticals also tend to be effective in markets with  **low implied volatility**, as these conditions have generally favored buying strategies.

The next step is to select a good underlying candidate. Frankly, good candidates are simply securities that are  **sideways or uptrending**. Of course, there’s no guarantee that the trend will continue.

You also want to look for underlying securities with highly liquid options. First, consider volume and open interest. Both of these tell you information about the liquidity of an option. Options with higher volume and open interest tend to have lower bid/ask spreads. Some traders define a bid/ask spread as 10% or less of the ask price.

Next, we need to select an option, which comes down to selecting an expiration and selecting a strike. A long call vertical is a short-term trade where you’d expect the move to happen soon after opening the trade. Therefore, options with an  **expiration**  of 20 to 50 days should do fine.

When it comes to selecting the  **strike**, think about how intrinsic and extrinsic value function in the trade. The intrinsic value of the long option drives the trade, so traders generally buy an ITM option. However, the extrinsic value of the short option offsets the extrinsic value of the long option, so traders generally sell an OTM option. This also helps reduce the cost.

Once we’ve selected an option, we need to determine how many spreads to trade. For this strategy, consider using this common **money management formula.**

The  **portfolio risk**  is the amount of your active trading portfolio you’re willing to risk on a single trade. For this strategy, consider a portfolio risk of 1% to 2%. For example, if you had a $100,000 active trading portfolio, you might risk $1,000 ($100,000 x .01).

The  **trade risk**  is the amount you’ll lose if the spread fails completely, or the max loss. This is simply the net debit received from the spread.

Let’s walk through an example. Say Trader B has a $50,000 active trading portfolio and he’s willing to risk 1% on a trade. His portfolio risk is $500 ($50,000 x .01). Now, say Trader B bought a long call for $2 and sold a short call for $1, leaving him with a debit of $1, or $100 per spread, not including transaction fees. This is the trade risk.

If we divide the **portfolio risk by the trade risk**, we learn that Trader B can buy five contracts ($500/$100) without risking more than 1% of his portfolio on the position.
