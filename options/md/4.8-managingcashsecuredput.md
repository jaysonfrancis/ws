#### Managing a Cash-Secured Put

Setting up a cash-secured put is only the beginning. Once you’ve opened the trade, you need to monitor your position and decide how to manage it. This comes back to your original goal—are you focusing on collecting premium, or are you trying to build a stock position? Again, keep in mind that assignment is more likely the closer you are to expiration, so consider making a decision between four and 10 days from expiration.

If the option is  **in the money** near expiration, you can  **roll it** to the next month to potentially generate additional premium,  **accept assignment**, or buy the contract back which could be at a loss.

If the option is  **out of the money**, you may be able to let it  **expire worthless**—this allows you to keep the premium you received. The upside is that you can keep the premium as income and do the trade again the next month, if you want. The downside, if your objective was to scale in to a stock, is that you won’t be assigned shares of a stock you wanted to buy.

As you review your open positions, keep your goals in mind and make sure you’ve got a plan for how you’re going to get out of the trades.
