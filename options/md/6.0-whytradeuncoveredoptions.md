#### Why Trade Uncovered Options
The last type of options strategies we’ll cover in this course are advanced strategies because they’re uncovered options. In this lesson, we’ll define uncovered options, their potential risks and benefits, and who should consider trading them.

Uncovered options are short options trades that  **don’t have an offsetting or covering position to help manage risk**. Because they’re uncovered, these type of trades are also commonly referred to as “naked” trades. Sophisticated option traders use these strategies to generate income by collecting premium. Because they lack an offsetting position, they can be more capital efficient. However, with this capital efficiency comes much higher risk.

For example, imagine you sold a call option and you didn’t own 100 shares of the underlying stock. If the option ended up deep in the money and the buyer exercised the option, you wouldn’t have the stock on hand to fulfill your end of the deal but you would still have to deliver the shares out of your account. So, you’d end up with a short stock position, which carries unlimited risk. Therefore, when you trade uncovered call options, you’re exposed to unlimited risk because there is no limit to how high the price of the underlying stock can climb.

Let’s examine the risks and benefits of uncovered options, starting with the risks. First, these trades have a  **very large or even unlimited downside risk potential**. One bad trade could easily wipe out several good trades. And a really bad trade could potentially wipe out your whole account. Here’s an example. Say you sell an out-of-the-money put with a strike price of $50 for $100. Unlike a cash-secured put, with this trade you have only a portion of the cash in your account to buy the stock if the option is exercised. The upside? You keep the premium gained. But if the option is exercised, you’re obligated to buy the stock at $50 per share no matter what the current price is. If the stock drops to zero, you’d lose $4,900 (the amount required to fulfill your obligations less the premium received for selling the put). The $100 premium is a small consolation when you have to cough up five grand, especially if you have to sell other investments to come up with the money.

As this example illustrates, uncovered option traders are  **highly reliant on the underlying stock’s price**  for their success. And while a very large price movement is rare, it happens. The stock doesn’t even need to climb to infinity or fall to zero for a big loss to be realized. And since uncovered options are high risk and low return, one big loss can wipe out the gains from a few successful trades.

This example highlights another risk—**assignment risk**. You’re familiar with this from other selling strategies you’ve learned. But as we’ve already discussed, assignment can be even riskier if you don’t have an offsetting position. Plus, you may end up buying shares you don’t want to own, using money you had earmarked for other purposes.

Finally, selling uncovered options requires  **margin**. When you trade on margin, you’re required to cover a portion of the total cost and your broker covers the rest. You’re charged a monthly interest payment on the amount borrowed. These interest payments vary depending on your account, but whatever they are, they cut into your trade’s profitability. Be sure you understand your margin costs before trading uncovered options.

Additionally, when you trade on margin, there’s also the possibility of a margin call, which occurs when the margin amount required for the positions you hold exceeds the equity in your account. If this happens, you may be required to deposit more funds or sell additional assets.

Now that you know the risks, let’s talk about the benefits. One benefit is the  **potential for profit** if an uncovered option expires out of the money. When an uncovered option expires worthless, the seller keeps the premium and is not required to fulfill her obligations.

Another benefit is that uncovered options have  **lower capital requirements**. There are two reasons for this. First, when you trade uncovered options, you don’t initially have to spend any capital related directly to the trade, such as owning stock or buying another option as a hedge. You will have a margin requirement, which is normally less than the cost of the stock, but it can still be a significant amount. Second, because you aren’t buying any other securities, you pay less in commissions and fees.

As you can see from the risks and benefits, uncovered options aren’t for every option trader. These strategies are best for very experienced option traders who fully understand the risks, are financially able to meet the applicable margin requirements, and can withstand potentially substantial losses. These traders also must feel confident that the underlying investments will move in the desired direction and know how to manage the trade if it doesn’t. This kind of speculation can take considerable resources—traders need to be able to cover the costs of owning stock or selling stock if things goes wrong.

Before we move on, here’s a quick overview of the strategies we’ll cover in this lesson. We’ll start with  **naked calls** and  **naked puts**. These strategies involve either selling a call without owning the stock or selling a put without having the full amount of money set aside to buy the stock. Like buying a long call or a long put, a strategy consisting of selling a naked call or a naked put is called a single-leg strategy.

Next, we’ll look at  **two-leg strategies**  known as short straddles and short strangles. A  **short straddle**  involves simultaneously selling a call and put at the same strike price in the same expiration. When trading this strategy, you’re placing a bet the stock will stay at or near the strike price. A  **short strangle**  involves simultaneously selling a call and a put at different strike prices in the same expiration. This strategy involves wagering that the stock will stay within a certain range. We’ll spend the rest of this lesson discussing these strategies.
