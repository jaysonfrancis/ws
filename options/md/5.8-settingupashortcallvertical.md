#### Setting Up a Short Call Vertical

Now that you've learned the concepts of short verticals, let's apply that understanding to actually placing a trade. To demonstrate, we'll use a short call vertical.

Remember, with a short call vertical, the trader **sells** one call contract to generate income (primarily through time decay) and simultaneously **buys** another call contract further out of the money to hedge the trade. This strategy is bearish to sideways, so the option traders who may be considering this strategy are typically **bearish** on the underlying and may be expecting **high volatility**. Higher volatility is generally favorable for selling strategies because it increases the premium; since the short call drives this trade, it can be considered a selling strategy.

Next, let's talk about what type of securities make good candidates for this strategy. Unlike the income-based strategies we looked at earlier, we're not evaluating securities we own or want to own. A spread is purely a trade and not an investment. The underlying should ideally be **downtrending**. A downtrending security gives traders the greatest confidence that the price will remain below the short strike and expire worthless. A trader could also use a security in a **sideways** trend. Again, there’s no guarantee that any trend will continue into the future.

When it comes to the options themselves, consider volume and open interest. Options with higher volume and open interest tend to have lower bid/ask spreads. Remember, options with **low bid/ask spreads**, those that are 10% or less of the ask price, are more favorable. This is most important for the short call because its value drives the trade's profitability, and you may need to buy it back later. The long call acts as a measure of protection and theoretically has a greater chance of expiring worthless, so the bid/ask spread for the long option is not as important.

Once we've chosen an underlying, we can move on to choosing the options contract itself, which is a matter of selecting an expiration and a strike. In terms of the **expiration**, the same principles apply that you’ve learned with other strategies. The closer you are to expiration, the faster time decay works and the lower the premium. The further you are from expiration, the slower time decay works and the higher the premium. Again, since this strategy is driven by the short call, many traders favor the balance of time decay and healthy premium found between 20 to 50 days from expiration.

In terms of the  **strike**, we need to consider the strike for both the short and the long call. Again, similar principles apply when selecting the  **short strike**. The lower the delta, the less likely the option is to be assigned and the lower the premium. The higher the delta, the more likely the option is to be assigned and the higher the premium. For this strategy, the ideal outcome is for both strikes to expire worthless, so many traders favor short strikes with lower deltas. Selling out-of-the-money options can potentially increase your probability of success.

When it comes to the  **long strike**, look for one that’s further out of the money, or above the short strike. The further out of the money you go, the lower the premium you’ll have to pay for this position, which increases the trade’s overall profitability. However, the further out of the money you go, the more you’ll increase your potential max loss. Typically, risk increases more than the potential returns, so the best balance of risk to return might be sticking a little closer to the short strike.

In terms of choosing how many spreads to buy, the considerations are very similar to what you learned for long verticals, so we'll just do a quick review. The basic formula is to calculate the **portfolio risk**, or amount of your active portfolio you’re willing to risk on a single trade, then divide that by the **trade risk** for the **number of spreads**. For spreads, the trade risk is the difference between the short and long strikes minus the net credit received from the spread.
