#### Short Vertical Options Greeks	

Now that you have an understanding of how short verticals work, let’s look at how changes in price, time, and implied volatility can impact a trade’s outcome. We’ll start with  **short call verticals**.

As with other income strategies, delta is the biggest driver of profitability. Short call verticals are  **delta-negative**. This illustrates that this strategy is bearish, as it can profit if the price of the underlying stays the same or decreases.

As our example showed, the short call will always have higher negative delta, while the long call will always have lower positive delta.

Gamma changes depending on whether the current price is below or above the halfway point between your two strike prices.

If you’re below the halfway point,  **gamma is negative**. This indicates that the negative delta increases as price moves between the two strikes.

If you’re above the halfway point, then  **gamma is positive**. On this side of things, gamma is slowing down delta, which decelerates as it moves toward max loss.

Delta has less influence as the underlying price goes down because of the maximum gain; it also has less influence as the underlying price goes up because of the maximum loss. As with other income strategies, gamma chips away at delta until it plateaus at either strike. This is visible in the risk profile when we look at the trade with extrinsic value.

Theta also varies depending on whether you’re above or below the halfway point between the two strikes.

If you’re below this halfway point, this strategy is  **theta-positive**. In this case, time decay works for you and potentially makes the trade more profitable each day the trade is open. But keep in mind that the most you can make is the net credit you initially received when you opened the trade.

On the other hand, above the halfway point,  **theta is negative**. Here, theta works against you each day, as the risk profile moves toward max loss.

To the left of the halfway point, short call verticals are  **vega-negative**. As implied volatility increases, the risk profile stretches out, reducing your profits and making it so that the price has to drop even further to approach maximum loss.

Above the halfway point, a short call vertical is  **vega-positive**. Here, rises in implied volatility push you away from max loss and help reduce the rate at which losses stack up, if the underlying price continues to rally.

The greeks for  **short put verticals** are similar to a short call vertical.

For example, a short put vertical is  **delta-positive**, which makes sense since it’s a bullish strategy.

All bullish positions are delta-positive—this just means they increase in value when the underlying goes up. In this case, delta is capped at the long (higher) strike at expiration.
