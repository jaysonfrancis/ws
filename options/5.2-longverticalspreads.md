#### Long Vertical Spreads

There are multiple types of spreads, but in this lesson we’re going to focus on vertical spreads, starting with long vertical spreads. A **long vertical** is when you purchase one option, then sell another option with the same expiration but further out of the money to lower the cost of the long position and limit risk.

When trading long vertical spreads, the **long option is the driver**, or in other words, the position which drives the profit. It may help to think of long vertical spreads as if you’re simply buying a long call or a long put. It’s a way to speculate on the movement of the underlying, while managing some risk.

There are two types of long verticals: **long call verticals** and **long put verticals**. These strategies are similar, although they have slightly different constructions and biases. A long call vertical is constructed with call options and is typically short-term bullish, while a long put vertical is constructed with put options and is typically short-term bearish.

During this lesson, we’ll use  **long call verticals**  to illustrate and explain long verticals. And we’ll point out critical differences with long put verticals.

As we mentioned, long call verticals are a bullish strategy—option traders often use these when they have a neutral or bullish outlook on the underlying.

**Components of a long call vertical and their biases**

Let’s talk through the construction of this strategy in a little more detail. First, you  **buy a call**  for a debit. The purpose of this option is to speculate on the underlying. However, depending on which call you buy, your option would likely be some mix of intrinsic and extrinsic value. The extrinsic value creates two obstacles to your success. First, you need the  **price to move up**  high enough to compensate for the extrinsic value before you can make a profit. Second, extrinsic value melts away every day because of  **time decay**. To help manage these risks, you  **sell an option** that’s higher or further out of the money. The premium or credit collected from this position lowers the total cost of the trade, which means you don’t need as big of a move in the underlying to break even. And because the short OTM position is entirely extrinsic value, it offsets some, if not all, of the loss of value in the long option due to time decay.

Now, let’s look at the long call vertical  **risk profile**  and discuss its risk and return. Notice the two horizontal lines. These illustrate the defined risk and return. The  **maximum loss** is the net premium paid, or the net debit, on the trade. The  **maximum gain** is the difference between the two strikes minus the net premium. The strategy  **breaks even** at the long call strike plus the net premium.
