#### Long Vertical Spreads

There are multiple types of spreads, but in this lesson we’re going to focus on vertical spreads, starting with long vertical spreads. A **long vertical** is when you purchase one option, then sell another option with the same expiration but further out of the money to lower the cost of the long position and limit risk.

When trading long vertical spreads, the **long option is the driver**, or in other words, the position which drives the profit. It may help to think of long vertical spreads as if you’re simply buying a long call or a long put. It’s a way to speculate on the movement of the underlying, while managing some risk.

There are two types of long verticals: **long call verticals** and **long put verticals**. These strategies are similar, although they have slightly different constructions and biases. A long call vertical is constructed with call options and is typically short-term bullish, while a long put vertical is constructed with put options and is typically short-term bearish.
