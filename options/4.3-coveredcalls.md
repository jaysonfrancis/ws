#### Covered Calls

Now that you’ve been introduced to the two income-based options strategies we’ll cover, let’s dive a little deeper, starting with covered calls. This is the first options strategy for many new option traders. The reason for this is that covered calls are less complex than many other options strategies and can be used in combination with a stock portfolio.

For many traders, the goal of this strategy is  **to generate income by selling out-of-the-money calls that ideally expire worthless**. To manage risk, you only trade options on stock you own. This stock serves as collateral—if you get assigned, the stock will be automatically sold to fulfill your obligations.

In terms of construction, this strategy has two parts. First, there’s a  **long stock position**. You’ll need to own 100 shares of the underlying stock for each options contract you’re going to sell. Second, there’s a  **short call**  on the same underlying. The stock position is bullish, and the short call is bearish. However, when these positions are combined, the overall strategy is bullish.

You can tell the strategy is bullish by looking at the risk profile.

As you can see, there’s limited profit potential: the  **maximum gain**  of the trade is equal to the premium received from the short call and any gains in the underlying up to the strike price (minus commissions and fees). Since this strategy includes a stock position, the  **maximum loss** is the same as owning stock and occurs if the underlying stock falls to zero, less the premium received from selling the option.

The  **break-even point** is the purchase price of the stock minus the short call’s premium.

Let’s look at an example to pull all of this together. Let’s say you own 100 shares of XYZ stock and you bought it at $46 per share. To earn additional income on your position, you sold a call for a credit of $100. The call expires in 30 days and has a 48 strike.

Since you bought the shares at $46, the break-even point is $45 ($46 – $1). If the stock falls anywhere from $46 to $45, the premium will offset the losses and the trade would still be profitable. But if the stock drops lower than $45, you’d start to lose money.

Now, let’s say that the stock goes up to $49 at expiration. In this case, your option is in the money, and you’d likely be assigned to sell your 100 shares of stock at $48 per share. As a result, you’d keep all the premium from the short call ($1 per share, or $100 for one contract) plus all the stock profits up to the strike price ([$48 – $46] x 100, or $200). The total profit from this trade is $300, not including commissions and fees. Note that your profits in the stock were capped at the strike price—this is one of the downsides of selling covered calls.

On the other hand, let’s say that the stock only goes up to $47 at expiration. In this case, your option is out of the money and would expire worthless, allowing you to keep the full premium of $100 and the $100 of price appreciation ([$47 – $46] x 100) for a total profit of $200, not including commissions and fees.

One benefit of the covered call strategy is that it can be  **successful in many scenarios**. If the stock goes up, the trade is profitable, even if you end up selling the stock. If the stock goes down a little, the call acts as a hedge and can offset some losses with the value of the premium. The trade is only unprofitable if the stock falls more than the value of the premium, or below the break-even point.
