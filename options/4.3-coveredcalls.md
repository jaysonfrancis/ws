#### Covered Calls

Now that you’ve been introduced to the two income-based options strategies we’ll cover, let’s dive a little deeper, starting with covered calls. This is the first options strategy for many new option traders. The reason for this is that covered calls are less complex than many other options strategies and can be used in combination with a stock portfolio.

For many traders, the goal of this strategy is  **to generate income by selling out-of-the-money calls that ideally expire worthless**. To manage risk, you only trade options on stock you own. This stock serves as collateral—if you get assigned, the stock will be automatically sold to fulfill your obligations.

In terms of construction, this strategy has two parts. First, there’s a  **long stock position**. You’ll need to own 100 shares of the underlying stock for each options contract you’re going to sell. Second, there’s a  **short call**  on the same underlying. The stock position is bullish, and the short call is bearish. However, when these positions are combined, the overall strategy is bullish.

You can tell the strategy is bullish by looking at the risk profile.

As you can see, there’s limited profit potential: the  **maximum gain**  of the trade is equal to the premium received from the short call and any gains in the underlying up to the strike price (minus commissions and fees). Since this strategy includes a stock position, the  **maximum loss** is the same as owning stock and occurs if the underlying stock falls to zero, less the premium received from selling the option.

The  **break-even point** is the purchase price of the stock minus the short call’s premium.
