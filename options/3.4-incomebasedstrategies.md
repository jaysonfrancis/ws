#### Income-Based Options Strategies

Hopefully, by now, you have a foundation of options knowledge—how they work, how they’re priced, and more. The rest of this course focuses on specific strategies. At this point, you may choose to review the first three lessons before moving on, or you may choose to explore the strategies and then go back to the basics. But before we move on, let’s look at an overview of all the strategies we’ll cover for quick reference. In this course the strategies are divided into three types: single-leg  **income-based**  options strategies,  **spread**  options strategies, and  **uncovered**  options strategies. We’ll define each of these types and give an overview of each strategy over the next few pages. We’ll start with income-based options strategies.

**Income-based** options strategies attempt to generate a relatively small amount of profit by selling options, and commonly combine both options and stock. Specifically, with these strategies, you’ll either own or want to own the underlying stock. These strategies are often the first that new option traders choose to learn about. The two income-based options strategies in this course are  **covered calls**  and  **cash-secured puts**.

-   **Objective**: To generate income by selling out-of-the-money options and (ideally) having them expire worthless. Risk is managed by using stocks you already own as collateral if the option is exercised. The strategy limits the upside potential of the underlying stock position, as the stock would likely be called away in the event of substantial stock price increase.
-   **Risk Profile**: Limited max gain, limited but very significant max loss (comparable max loss to owning stock)

-   **Investor Types**: Option traders with a portfolio of stocks looking to generate additional income or exit an existing stock position at a specific price

-   **Objective**: Similar to covered calls, the objective is to generate a small amount of income by selling an out-of-the-money options contract. However, with a cash-secured put, you use cash in your account instead of stock to manage risk. If the option is assigned, you’ll use this cash to purchase the shares of the underlying. This strategy can also be used to potentially enter a stock position at a specific price. However, when doing this, there’s significant risk of purchasing the corresponding underlying at the strike price when the market price of the stock will likely be lower.

-   **Risk Profile**: Limited max gain (limited to the premium received), limited but very significant max loss (comparable max loss to owning stock)
