#### Income-Based Options Strategies

Hopefully, by now, you have a foundation of options knowledge—how they work, how they’re priced, and more. The rest of this course focuses on specific strategies. At this point, you may choose to review the first three lessons before moving on, or you may choose to explore the strategies and then go back to the basics. But before we move on, let’s look at an overview of all the strategies we’ll cover for quick reference. In this course the strategies are divided into three types: single-leg  **income-based**  options strategies,  **spread**  options strategies, and  **uncovered**  options strategies. We’ll define each of these types and give an overview of each strategy over the next few pages. We’ll start with income-based options strategies.

**Income-based** options strategies attempt to generate a relatively small amount of profit by selling options, and commonly combine both options and stock. Specifically, with these strategies, you’ll either own or want to own the underlying stock. These strategies are often the first that new option traders choose to learn about. The two income-based options strategies in this course are  **covered calls**  and  **cash-secured puts**.

-   **Objective**: To generate income by selling out-of-the-money options and (ideally) having them expire worthless. Risk is managed by using stocks you already own as collateral if the option is exercised. The strategy limits the upside potential of the underlying stock position, as the stock would likely be called away in the event of substantial stock price increase.
