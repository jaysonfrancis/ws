#### Setting Up a Cash-Secured Put

Now we’ll walk through the decisions related to setting up a cash-secured put. To recap, a cash-secured put is constructed with two main elements—a  **short put**  and  **sufficient cash in your account** to buy the stock if you get assigned. The strategy is typically used to potentially  **generate income**. Some traders use cash-secured puts as a way to  **enter a stock position**. The premium received helps offset the cost of the stock, lowering the net cost. The risk with this strategy is getting assigned and purchasing the corresponding stock at the strike price when the market price of the stock will likely be lower.
