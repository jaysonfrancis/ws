#### Setting Up a Cash-Secured Put

Now we’ll walk through the decisions related to setting up a cash-secured put. To recap, a cash-secured put is constructed with two main elements—a  **short put**  and  **sufficient cash in your account** to buy the stock if you get assigned. The strategy is typically used to potentially  **generate income**. Some traders use cash-secured puts as a way to  **enter a stock position**. The premium received helps offset the cost of the stock, lowering the net cost. The risk with this strategy is getting assigned and purchasing the corresponding stock at the strike price when the market price of the stock will likely be lower.

The ideal market conditions are similar to those for covered calls—this strategy works best in a bullish environment with higher volatility (this increases the premium, which is good for sellers).

Now, let’s talk about which stocks and options make good candidates for cash-secured puts. When it comes to choosing the underlying, consider equities  **you want to own**. Even if you want to focus on generating income, there’s always the possibility of assignment. Finally, like covered calls, the stock also needs to be  **optionable**.

Next, we’ll move on to **selecting an expiration**  and  **choosing a strike price**.

As we discussed previously, options that are further from expiration tend to have more extrinsic value and therefore higher premiums. If you choose an expiration that’s too far out, however, theta will be very low. For cash-secured puts, many traders see 30 days as a good balance between healthy premiums and a steady rate of time decay. This also allows them the potential to trade the strategy monthly, though there’s no guarantee they can trade the strategy consistently every month.

Next is  **strike selection** for the short put. Again, choosing a strike is about balancing premium and likelihood of getting assigned. Many traders find that options with a delta between .30 and .40 provide a balance of probability of success and a reasonable return. However, the strike you choose depends on your objective: are you trying to generate income or open a stock position? If your goal is income, consider strikes with lower deltas. These options may have lower premium, but they also have a lower probability of getting assigned. If your goal is to scale in to a stock position, consider strikes with higher deltas, which are more likely to be assigned.
