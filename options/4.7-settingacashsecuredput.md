#### Setting Up a Cash-Secured Put

Now we’ll walk through the decisions related to setting up a cash-secured put. To recap, a cash-secured put is constructed with two main elements—a  **short put**  and  **sufficient cash in your account** to buy the stock if you get assigned. The strategy is typically used to potentially  **generate income**. Some traders use cash-secured puts as a way to  **enter a stock position**. The premium received helps offset the cost of the stock, lowering the net cost. The risk with this strategy is getting assigned and purchasing the corresponding stock at the strike price when the market price of the stock will likely be lower.

The ideal market conditions are similar to those for covered calls—this strategy works best in a bullish environment with higher volatility (this increases the premium, which is good for sellers).

Now, let’s talk about which stocks and options make good candidates for cash-secured puts. When it comes to choosing the underlying, consider equities  **you want to own**. Even if you want to focus on generating income, there’s always the possibility of assignment. Finally, like covered calls, the stock also needs to be  **optionable**.

Next, we’ll move on to **selecting an expiration**  and  **choosing a strike price**.

As we discussed previously, options that are further from expiration tend to have more extrinsic value and therefore higher premiums. If you choose an expiration that’s too far out, however, theta will be very low. For cash-secured puts, many traders see 30 days as a good balance between healthy premiums and a steady rate of time decay. This also allows them the potential to trade the strategy monthly, though there’s no guarantee they can trade the strategy consistently every month.

Next is  **strike selection** for the short put. Again, choosing a strike is about balancing premium and likelihood of getting assigned. Many traders find that options with a delta between .30 and .40 provide a balance of probability of success and a reasonable return. However, the strike you choose depends on your objective: are you trying to generate income or open a stock position? If your goal is income, consider strikes with lower deltas. These options may have lower premium, but they also have a lower probability of getting assigned. If your goal is to scale in to a stock position, consider strikes with higher deltas, which are more likely to be assigned.

After choosing a contract, determine how much to trade. Since one potential outcome of a cash-secured put is purchasing the stock, the primary consideration is  **the cost of assignment**. In other words, you need to think about how much stock you can afford to buy if you get assigned.

While some option traders might be tempted to focus only on the risk of the options themselves, it’s important to consider your portfolio allocations. How much you allocate to this position depends on your own risk tolerance. If you’re more conservative, you may only want to devote 5% of your total account value to a single stock; if you’re more aggressive, you might allocate closer to 10%.

Also, as we mentioned earlier, many traders select options with a  **bid/ask spread that is 10% or less of the ask price**.

Let’s walk through an example. Trader A decides that she wants to sell a put on XYZ, which is currently trading at $39, and it’s a stock she wouldn’t mind owning if she was assigned. Her total account value is $150,000, and in keeping with her stock portfolio’s diversification rules, she decides to calculate her position size at 5% of that value. That means she could handle a cost of assignment up to $7,500 ($150,000 x 0.05).

She wants to sell the 35 put. On assignment, each contract would cost her $3,500 to convert into shares, not including transaction costs. The most she could sell would be two contracts ($7,500/$3,500 = 2.14).
