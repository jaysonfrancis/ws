#### Setting Up a Covered Call

As we’ve discussed, placing an options trade involves a series of decisions about what to trade, how much to trade, and when to exit. Now that you’re familiar with how covered calls and cash-secured puts work, let’s talk about what to consider when actually implementing these strategies. We’ll start with covered calls.

As you know, a covered call comprises an underlying stock you own and call option you sell. The goal is typically to generate income without the option getting assigned. A short call alone can potentially profit if the price of the underlying stock drops a little, stays the same, or moves slightly up, but since the covered call also includes a stock position,  **a bullish market**  is the ideal condition for this strategy. If price rises a little but stays below the strike price, traders can make money on their stock position without getting assigned—it’s the best of both worlds.

Deciding what to trade has two parts: choosing an underlying security and choosing an options contract. When it comes to choosing the underlying, because of the risk of assignment, you should  **only write covered calls on securities you’re willing to sell at the strike price you choose**. Even in trades with a high probability of the option expiring worthless, assignment is still a possibility. However, keep in mind that even when assignment happens, it can still be a profitable trade, as long as you ultimately sell the underlying stock for more than you paid for it. Since this is a bullish trade, consider stocks that are  **uptrending**  (though there’s no guarantee that the trend will continue). The stock also needs to be  **optionable**.

Once you’ve chosen an underlying, you need to choose an options contract. This  **includes selecting an expiration**  and  **choosing a strike price**. Many traders seek to sell options that offer a good potential return and have a strong probability of expiring out of the money (worthless for the buyer).
