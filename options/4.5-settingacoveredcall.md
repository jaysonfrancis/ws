#### Setting Up a Covered Call

As we’ve discussed, placing an options trade involves a series of decisions about what to trade, how much to trade, and when to exit. Now that you’re familiar with how covered calls and cash-secured puts work, let’s talk about what to consider when actually implementing these strategies. We’ll start with covered calls.

As you know, a covered call comprises an underlying stock you own and call option you sell. The goal is typically to generate income without the option getting assigned. A short call alone can potentially profit if the price of the underlying stock drops a little, stays the same, or moves slightly up, but since the covered call also includes a stock position,  **a bullish market**  is the ideal condition for this strategy. If price rises a little but stays below the strike price, traders can make money on their stock position without getting assigned—it’s the best of both worlds.

Deciding what to trade has two parts: choosing an underlying security and choosing an options contract. When it comes to choosing the underlying, because of the risk of assignment, you should  **only write covered calls on securities you’re willing to sell at the strike price you choose**. Even in trades with a high probability of the option expiring worthless, assignment is still a possibility. However, keep in mind that even when assignment happens, it can still be a profitable trade, as long as you ultimately sell the underlying stock for more than you paid for it. Since this is a bullish trade, consider stocks that are  **uptrending**  (though there’s no guarantee that the trend will continue). The stock also needs to be  **optionable**.

Once you’ve chosen an underlying, you need to choose an options contract. This  **includes selecting an expiration**  and  **choosing a strike price**. Many traders seek to sell options that offer a good potential return and have a strong probability of expiring out of the money (worthless for the buyer).

When it comes to  **selecting an expiration**, there are pros and cons to every expiration in an option chain. If you select an option close to expiration, you’ll enter the trade when the option has faster time decay. However, the total premium will be lower. On the other hand, an option further from expiration typically has a much higher premium because it’s further from expiration and therefore has more extrinsic value. But this higher premium is compensation for higher risk—a longer expiration means more time for the trade to move against you. The expiration you choose is a trade-off between the speed of time decay and the level of premium. Many traders seek a balance between the two and favor options between 20 and 50 days to expiration.

The expiration you choose is also a function of how frequently you want to employ this strategy. Some traders, hoping to generate monthly income, favor options close to 30 days to expiration.

After selecting an expiration, the next step is to **choose the strike price**  for your short call. To do this, you’ll need to examine the delta. As you may recall, delta is commonly used to determine how much the price of the option will change with a dollar move of the underlying stock. However, many traders also use it to estimate the likelihood of the option expiring in the money. For example, an option with a delta of .40 has approximately a 40% chance of being in the money at expiration. This means it also has a 60% chance of expiring worthless—which is the ideal outcome when selling a call.

_Probability analysis is theoretical in nature, not guaranteed, and does not reflect any degree of certainty of an event occurring_.

Therefore, the lower the delta, the lower the probability of assignment and the higher your probability of success. On the other hand, the lower the delta, the smaller the premium. Once again, you’ll need to think through these tradeoffs and determine which strike makes sense to you. For many, a call with a delta between .30 and .40 provides a balance between probability of success and a reasonable return.

Once you’ve chosen a contract, determining how much to trade is simple: sell no more than  **one contract for every 100 shares of stock you own**  and are willing to put at risk of assignment. Only selling contracts backed by shares you own is what makes the calls “covered.” This prevents you from having to purchase shares at a loss to fulfill the contract should you be assigned.

For example, assume you own 597 shares of a stock. A standard options contract is for 100 shares of the underlying. Therefore, you could sell up to five contracts.

And because you want high liquidity, consider options with a narrow bid/ask spread. A good guideline is to only consider options with a  **bid/ask spread that is 10% or less of the ask price**.
