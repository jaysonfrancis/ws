#### Advanced Options Strategies

Now that we’ve previewed a few basic options strategies, let’s look at some advanced strategies. The advanced strategies in this course are uncovered options. An uncovered option is a short options contract that doesn’t have an offsetting position to help mitigate risk. These are also known as “naked” options. The potential returns and probabilities of success are similar to some of the other strategies we’ve mentioned; however, because there is no offsetting position, the risk is  **significantly higher**. Naked options strategies involve the highest amount of risk and are only appropriate for option traders with the highest risk tolerance. Sophisticated option traders generally use these strategies to generate income by collecting premium. The uncovered options strategies taught in this course are naked calls, naked puts, short straddles, and short strangles.
