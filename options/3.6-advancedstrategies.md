#### Advanced Options Strategies

Now that we’ve previewed a few basic options strategies, let’s look at some advanced strategies. The advanced strategies in this course are uncovered options. An uncovered option is a short options contract that doesn’t have an offsetting position to help mitigate risk. These are also known as “naked” options. The potential returns and probabilities of success are similar to some of the other strategies we’ve mentioned; however, because there is no offsetting position, the risk is  **significantly higher**. Naked options strategies involve the highest amount of risk and are only appropriate for option traders with the highest risk tolerance. Sophisticated option traders generally use these strategies to generate income by collecting premium. The uncovered options strategies taught in this course are naked calls, naked puts, short straddles, and short strangles.

**Naked Calls**

-   **Objective**: To collect premium by selling an out-of-the-money call option without owning the underlying stock.
-   **Risk Profile**: High risk with limited potential max gain, unlimited potential max loss

-   **Investor Types**: Experienced option traders with the highest risk tolerance seeking to speculate on short-term, bearish price movement

**Naked Puts**

-   **Objective**: To collect premium by selling an out-of-the-money put option without an offsetting cash or long option position.

-   **Risk Profile**: Limited potential max gain, limited but substantial potential max loss. There’s a high risk that traders will have to purchase the underlying at the strike price when the market price of the stock is lower.

-   **Investor Types**: Experienced option traders with the highest risk tolerance seeking to speculate on short-term, bullish price movement

In addition to these uncovered single options strategies, there are also uncovered multiple-leg strategies. In this course we’ll discuss two: short straddles and short strangles.

**Short Straddles**

-   **Objective**: To collect premium by selling a naked call and a naked put with the same strike and expiration.

-   **Risk Profile**: Limited max gain, unlimited max loss (due to the naked call)

-   **Investor Types**: Experienced option traders with the highest risk tolerance seeking to speculate on short-term, sideways price movement

**Short Strangles**

-   **Objective**: To collect premium by selling a naked call and selling a naked put with the same expiration but different strikes. The strike of the short put is below that of the short call.

-   **Risk Profile**: Limited max gain, unlimited max loss (due to the naked call)
