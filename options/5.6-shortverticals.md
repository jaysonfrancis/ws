#### Short Verticals

Now, let’s explore another spread strategy: short verticals. In a short vertical, **you sell one option**, which generates income, and **buy another option further out of the money**, which can help manage risk.

There are two types of short verticals: short call verticals and short put verticals. These two strategies are very similar, except one is constructed with calls and is bearish (short call vertical) and one is constructed with puts and is bullish (short put vertical).

Because short call verticals and short put verticals are so similar, for most of this page we’ll focus on  **short call verticals**. Then at the end we’ll compare and contrast short call verticals and short put verticals.

Short call verticals are often used by option traders who have a  **short-term**  **bearish** outlook on the underlying. However, this strategy can be profitable when the underlying trends sideways as well.
