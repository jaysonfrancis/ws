#### Setting Up a Long Call Vertical

Now, letâ€™s walk through the decisions involved when actually setting up a long call vertical.

As a quick recap, a long call vertical involves  

- 1) **buying** a call and then  **selling** another call further out of the money to reduce the cost. Overall, the strategy is bullish, so the ideal condition is a **bullish market**. Since the strategy is driven by a long position, long verticals also tend to be effective in markets with  **low implied volatility**, as these conditions have generally favored buying strategies.
