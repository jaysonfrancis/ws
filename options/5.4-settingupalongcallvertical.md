#### Setting Up a Long Call Vertical

Now, let’s walk through the decisions involved when actually setting up a long call vertical.

As a quick recap, a long call vertical involves  

- 1) **buying** a call and then  
- 2) **selling** another call further out of the money to reduce the cost. 

Overall, the strategy is bullish, so the ideal condition is a **bullish market**. Since the strategy is driven by a long position, long verticals also tend to be effective in markets with  **low implied volatility**, as these conditions have generally favored buying strategies.

The next step is to select a good underlying candidate. Frankly, good candidates are simply securities that are  **sideways or uptrending**. Of course, there’s no guarantee that the trend will continue.

You also want to look for underlying securities with highly liquid options. First, consider volume and open interest. Both of these tell you information about the liquidity of an option. Options with higher volume and open interest tend to have lower bid/ask spreads. Some traders define a bid/ask spread as 10% or less of the ask price.

Next, we need to select an option, which comes down to selecting an expiration and selecting a strike. A long call vertical is a short-term trade where you’d expect the move to happen soon after opening the trade. Therefore, options with an  **expiration**  of 20 to 50 days should do fine.

When it comes to selecting the  **strike**, think about how intrinsic and extrinsic value function in the trade. The intrinsic value of the long option drives the trade, so traders generally buy an ITM option. However, the extrinsic value of the short option offsets the extrinsic value of the long option, so traders generally sell an OTM option. This also helps reduce the cost.
