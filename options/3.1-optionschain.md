#### The Options Chain

Now that you're well on your way to understanding the core concepts of options, it's time to discuss the mechanics of placing an options trade. When trading options, the decisions you need to make and the steps you'll take or buy or sell are different from those of stock trading.

The focus of this module is to examine these unique qualities so that you can understand how options trading works on any trading platforms.

We'll begin with an introduction to the **option chain**. The option chain (sometimes known as the options table) is a tool we use when initially selecting an option to buy or sell. 

An option chain displays information about available options and, in many trading platforms, is an interactive element used for buying and selling options. An option chain is essentially a series of tables. Each table corresponds to a different expiration. The information contained in each table provides details for all the available options at that expiration.

Let's give you the tour. often, when you first pull up an option chain, you'll see a list of expirations. Each of these expirations can be expanded to view the options for that expiration. Here are some common expirations you might see.

|  |  |
|--|--|
| Standard Options | Options that expire on the third Friday of a month. |
| Weekly Options | Options that expire on Fridays other than the third Friday. These options are typically only available on highly traded underlying securities. | 
| Quarterly Options | Options that expire on the last trading day of a quarter. (i.e, March, June, September, December). These are only available on highly traded underlying securities, or those with high market capitalizations. 
| LEAPS | LEAPS is an acronym for Long-term Equity AnticiPation Securities. These are options with an expiration longer than one year. These too are only available on highly traded underlying securities. Note that in some trading platforms, LEAPS options are not labeled as such, but you can identify them by the length of the expiration. 

Here is an example of how some of these options might look:

If you expand an expiration date, you can view information about each strike within that particular expiration. Information about calls is on the **left**, and puts on the **right**, with the strike price down the **center**.

Each row in the option chain represents an individual strike and lists information about that particular option. Options that are in the money (ITM) are shaded. Note that some columns are listed on both the calls and the puts side of the table. This is because calls and puts are totally separate contracts, even if they have the same expiration and strike. Therefore, the information listed on each side is different.  

The columns in an option chain can often be customized to provide you with a wealth of information about the available options. For example, in the option chain shown below, you can see an options greek is included. T
