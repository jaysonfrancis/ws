#### Managing a Covered Call

Once you’ve opened a covered call, you should monitor your positions to determine when it’s time for the trade to end or for another trade to begin. Let’s explore the various outcomes of a covered call trade and identify what exit considerations apply to both the call option and the stock. We’ll start with the option.

As the option nears expiration, there are two scenarios: either the option will be  **in the money**  (and at risk of assignment) or  **out of the money**.

The first scenario, the call being in the money, requires a little more decision making on your part. Remember, any time your option is in the money, you’re at risk of assignment. If you’re happy letting the stock go at the strike price, then there is nothing for you to do. You’d simply wait for the option to be assigned, wave goodbye to the shares, pay the assignment fee, and be happy with the premium received from the option. Plus, if you’d sold out an out-of-the-money call, you would’ve had some price gains in the stock as well. Your total profit would be equal to the options premium plus any stock appreciation. Unless the stock really skyrocketed and you missed out on a lot of upside, you can usually be pretty happy with this scenario.
