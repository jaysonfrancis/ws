#### Trading Naked Calls and Puts

Traders classify naked calls and puts as income strategies because they’re traded with the goal of collecting premium by selling options. Let’s examine both strategies side by side and see how they’re similar and how they differ.

A  **naked call**  strategy involves selling call options without owning the underlying in hopes of the option expiring worthless. A trader employs this strategy when he believes the underlying stock will stay below a certain price.

A  **naked put**  involves selling a put option without having cash on hand in hopes of the option expiring worthless. This strategy is used when the trader believes the underlying stock will stay above a certain price.

Now, let’s look at the risk profiles for each, side by side.

As you can see, both trades have very little upside potential and significant downside risk. The horizontal line denotes the  **maximum gain**, which is equal to the premium received. In the case of the call, the  **maximum loss**  goes on to infinity as there is no limit to how far a stock price can increase. With the put, the maximum loss is very large—equivalent to the amount lost per contract if the stock fell to zero less whatever premium you received. The  **break-even point** for a naked put is the strike price minus the premium received for selling the option, while for a naked call, it’s the strike price plus the premium received for selling the option. Keep in mind that risk profiles don’t commonly account for commissions and fees, so it’s up to you to understand how they can cut into your potential gains or increase potential losses.

Let’s put some numbers to it with an example of a naked call. Say XYZ is currently trading at $48. Trader A is bearish and sells a call with a 50 strike for $1.50, or $150.

Now, imagine XYZ experiences a large rally and closes at $56 at expiration. The option would be in the money, and Trader A would be assigned on her call and forced to sell 100 shares of XYZ at $50. Since she doesn’t own the shares, this would put her in a short position. If she couldn’t or didn’t want to hold the short position, she’d then have to cover it and buy the stock at the current market value on the next trading day. If the price stayed the same on the next trading day, it would be $56 per share. However, if the price moves it could be more or less. Assuming she was able to buy the shares at $56, the net loss for this transaction is -$600. After factoring in the premium she received for selling the call, her net loss is -$450, not including commissions and fees.

Now, imagine the stock stays where it is, and the stock closes at $48 at expiration. In this case, the option is out of the money and expires worthless. Trader A gets to keep the premium of $150, minus commissions and fees.

Finally, consider what would happen if the stock closed at $44 at expiration. Because the option is out of the money, it would again expire worthless. Trader A’s profit is equal to the premium ($150), minus commissions and fees. No matter how much the stock price drops, she’ll never make more than this.

Let’s talk about some characteristics of this strategy that the risk profile doesn’t reveal. First, naked calls and puts can both  **benefit from time decay**, which is common with selling strategies. Because of this, a trader can still earn a profit even if the stock moves sideways. When you sell an out-of-the-money option, you’re selling all extrinsic value, which melts over time.

Because of the significant risks involved in naked calls and puts, they should only be traded by options traders who are comfortable with significant or undefined risk and are financially able to withstand significant losses.
