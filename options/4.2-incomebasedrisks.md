#### Benefits and Risks with Income-Based Strategies

Let’s discuss the benefits and risks of income-based strategies, starting with the benefits. The primary benefit of these strategies is simple—it’s the potential for  **additional income**. By selling options and (hopefully) having them expire worthless, you earn extra money that can enhance your returns (excluding commissions and fees).

The income from these strategies can help lower the net cost of your equity positions. Take a cash-secured put, for example. If you sold a cash-secured put for $2 and, due to assignment, ended up purchasing 100 shares for $100 each, you’d lower your effective cost to $98 per share.

**A cash-secured put can help you enter a stock position at a net cost below its current market value**.

Another benefit of income-based options strategies is that they can offer a **high probability of success** with relatively  **low maintenance**. Of course, success is never guaranteed, so it’s important to fully understand any strategy before trading it.

Now, let’s turn to the risks. It’s important to understand why you are earning premium—it’s  **because you’re taking on risk**  similar to owning long stock, but with some subtle differences. To help illustrate this, compare the risk profile of a covered call to that of a long stock position.
