#### Benefits and Risks with Income-Based Strategies

Let’s discuss the benefits and risks of income-based strategies, starting with the benefits. The primary benefit of these strategies is simple—it’s the potential for  **additional income**. By selling options and (hopefully) having them expire worthless, you earn extra money that can enhance your returns (excluding commissions and fees).

The income from these strategies can help lower the net cost of your equity positions. Take a cash-secured put, for example. If you sold a cash-secured put for $2 and, due to assignment, ended up purchasing 100 shares for $100 each, you’d lower your effective cost to $98 per share.

**A cash-secured put can help you enter a stock position at a net cost below its current market value**.

Another benefit of income-based options strategies is that they can offer a **high probability of success** with relatively  **low maintenance**. Of course, success is never guaranteed, so it’s important to fully understand any strategy before trading it.

Now, let’s turn to the risks. It’s important to understand why you are earning premium—it’s  **because you’re taking on risk**  similar to owning long stock, but with some subtle differences. To help illustrate this, compare the risk profile of a covered call to that of a long stock position.

The covered call has significant downside risk and a limited upside return. The stock, on the other hand, has a similar level of risk and an unlimited return. So, why does one have different returns than the other? When you trade a covered call, you make a choice to **give up the unlimited potential upside** in **exchange for the options premium.** Before entering any trade, you should consider its trade-offs and determine if you feel you’re being fairly compensated for its risk.

Income-based options strategies are also subject to  **price risk**, or the risk that a security’s value will move against you. Price risk applies to the value of both the option and the underlying stock. Your profits depend on your ability to predict which direction price will move. There’s always the risk that it’ll move differently than expected, causing less desirable outcomes.

**If price moves in the wrong direction, you’ll end up with a losing trade**.

As with every short options strategy, income-based options strategies are at risk of  **assignment**. While some strategies have the goal of assignment, others don’t. If you’re assigned, you could end up closing a stock position earlier than you wanted, causing you to miss out on additional gains and dividends. Or, assignment could force you to enter a position that’s less than optimal, as the stock price may move against you.

**If assigned, you’d miss out on any future dividends**.

Assignment on a covered call can also trigger taxable events, such as capital gains. If the underlying has appreciated, you’ll need to consider tax implications if you sell the stock for a profit. Finally, while it depends on your broker, you’ll likely be charged a fee if assigned. This fee is typically higher than the fees you would’ve paid for closing the options trade.

Whenever you’re determining whether to trade a particular options strategy, you should compare the potential risk to the potential return and determine whether the ratio is right for you. Depending on how a trade is constructed, many options trades can have much higher risks than their potential returns. When the risks outweigh the returns, a few bad trades can wipe out the profits from a handful of good trades.

**One unsuccessful trade has the potential to outweigh several successful trades**.
