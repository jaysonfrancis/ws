#### Managing a Long Call Vertical

With a strong understanding of how to set up the trade, let’s look at how to manage a long call vertical trade. Again, it depends on whether the options are in the money or out of the money as the trade approaches expiration.

Let’s start with what to do if  **both options are in the money**. As the trade approaches expiration, volatility increases, which can put potential profit in jeopardy. Between four and 10 days to expiration, consider closing the trade to avoid early assignment on the short option.

Alternatively, consider closing the trade when it’s reached 75% – 80% of the max profit. This can help you to protect gains without exposing yourself to the higher risk that comes as the trade approaches expiration.

If, on the other hand,  **both options are out of the money**, the options will expire worthless and you will lose the entire amount invested in the trade. For this reason, there’s not much to be gained from closing the trades; however, you can remove some risk by buying back the short strike since there’s always at least a small chance you could be assigned. It’s important to factor transaction fees into the decision and weigh them against the potential risk, as it may cost you more to close the trade than keep it open.

If the price of the underlying is  **between the strikes** at expiration, consider closing both contracts. You may or may not have a profit. The long option will be worth approximately the difference between the strike price and the stock price, and the short option will be close to worthless. If you choose to close the long option, then you should probably close the short option at the same time. Otherwise, you have a naked short option, which exposes you to a lot of risk.
