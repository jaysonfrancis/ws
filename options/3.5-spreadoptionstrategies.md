#### Spread Options Strategies

Spread options strategies involve combining two or more different options contracts in a single trade. Contracts can be combined in a wide variety of ways, which gives traders the ability to create trades with varying potential returns, risks, and probabilities of success. Commonly, spread trades have a defined return and risk, which allows traders to know exactly how much they stand to potentially win or lose on a trade. In this course, we’ll cover long and short vertical spreads.

Before we begin, it’s important to understand that spread strategies have more transaction costs than other strategies, and sometimes these costs can be substantial. This is because they include multiple commissions, which may impact any potential returns. Remember, these are advanced options strategies that can involve greater and more complex risk than basic options trades. We’ll begin by introducing long verticals. There are two variations of this strategy: long call verticals and long put verticals.

-   **Objective**: To profit from an upward price move in the underlying by buying a call option and selling another call with the same expiration at a higher strike. The premium collected from the short call reduces the cost of the long call and increases its probability of success, but also limits the trade’s maximum profit.

-   **Risk Profile**: Limited max gain, limited max loss
