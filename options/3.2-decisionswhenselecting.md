#### Decisions to Make When Selecting an Options Contract

Now that you’ve been introduced to the option chain, let’s put it in context by identifying the decisions you need to make when selecting and placing an options trade.

First, you need to pick the underlying security for your options trade. In addition to determining which underlying is right for your strategy, you also need to find out if the underlying is  **optionable**—meaning, whether options are offered for that underlying. While most offer options, some thinly traded equities or certain types of funds (e.g., leveraged funds) do not.

You can identify whether an underlying is option-able by pulling it up in a trading platform and seeing if an option chain is available. If there isn’t one listed, then the underlying is not option-able.
