#### Decisions to Make When Selecting an Options Contract

Now that you’ve been introduced to the option chain, let’s put it in context by identifying the decisions you need to make when selecting and placing an options trade.

First, you need to pick the underlying security for your options trade. In addition to determining which underlying is right for your strategy, you also need to find out if the underlying is  **optionable**—meaning, whether options are offered for that underlying. While most offer options, some thinly traded equities or certain types of funds (e.g., leveraged funds) do not.

You can identify whether an underlying is option-able by pulling it up in a trading platform and seeing if an **option chain** is available. If there isn’t one listed, then the underlying is not option-able.

Next, you need to determine whether you’re bullish or bearish and whether you want to take on more or less risk. These decisions impact the  **strategy you choose**, which in turn determines whether you’ll buy or sell a call, put, or a combination of contracts. For example, if you’re bullish and want to have a defined risk and potentially unlimited return, you could buy a call.

The next decisions you’ll need to make are the details of the option, including  **expiration** and  **strike selection**. As you’ll learn, the expiration and strike selection you choose will vary depending on the objective of a given strategy.

For example, consider the option chain below. There are generally a large range of expirations for any underlying. Why choose an option with 24 days to expiration versus one with 241 days? Think about what you’ve learned about time to expiration: value decays as an option approaches expiration, and that decay (**known as theta**) happens faster closer to expiration. **Theta works in favor of sellers** and **against buyers.** Therefore, strategies involving the buying of options typically favor longer expirations with slower time decay, while selling strategies generally prefer nearer expirations, which have faster time decay.
