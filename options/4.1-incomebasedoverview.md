#### Why consider income-based options strategies?

Up to this point, we’ve been focusing on the core concepts of options trading. From this point on, we’re going to dive into each of the three types of options strategies. In this lesson, we’ll cover the fundamentals of income-based options strategies.

When we refer to “**income-based options strategies,**” we’re speaking about those where you sell options to generate income. Income-based options selling strategies are generally categorized as such because you receive the premium, which is money in your pocket. These strategies are risky though, because they obligate you to either buy or sell the underlying if the option is exercised. However, when we discuss the strategies, we’ll also discuss techniques to help manage this risk.

In this lesson we’ll focus on two strategies: **covered calls** and **cash-secured puts**.

Let’s look at a few different examples of how these strategies work.

Trader A has a large stock portfolio. On average, he sells  **covered calls**  on his stock positions every two months. In this type of trade, he sells a call and uses his stock as collateral in case the option is exercised. The goal of this strategy is for the premium he receives from these trades to improve his overall returns. When the trade works out well, he gets to hold on to his stock and collect the premium from selling the call. One downside of this strategy is that it will limit the upside potential of the underlying stock position because the stock would likely be called away if the underlying stock price increased. If this was to happen, the trader would miss out on any appreciation above the strike price. A second downside is that although the premium received provides some protection if the stock price falls, the trader could lose more than that premium amount. Thus, Trader A is still exposed to the same risks of stock ownership.
