#### Why consider income-based options strategies?

Up to this point, we’ve been focusing on the core concepts of options trading. From this point on, we’re going to dive into each of the three types of options strategies. In this lesson, we’ll cover the fundamentals of income-based options strategies.

When we refer to “**income-based options strategies,**” we’re speaking about those where you sell options to generate income. Income-based options selling strategies are generally categorized as such because you receive the premium, which is money in your pocket.

In this lesson we’ll focus on two strategies: **covered calls** and **cash-secured puts**.
