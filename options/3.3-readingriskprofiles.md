#### Reading a Risk Profile

The risk profile is another important piece of information commonly found in the options world. The  **risk profile**  is a chart that can help you identify the potential risk and return of an options trade, and how your trade is likely to perform based on the price of the underlying stock.

At first glance, a risk profile looks a lot like a price chart. However, a risk profile is very different. A price chart plots a stock’s market price over time. The y-axis of the chart shows price, while the x-axis serves as a timeline. A risk profile, on the other hand, plots a trader’s theoretical **profit/loss**  on the y-axis over the  **underlying stock price**  **at expiration**  on the x-axis. In other words, it tells you how much your position may gain or lose when the underlying stock is at a certain price at expiration.

To practice interpreting these profiles, let’s look at a few examples, starting with the risk profile for a **long call**. This is a very bullish strategy that can become more profitable as the price of the underlying increases.

Let’s say we bought the 60 call for a $350 premium. If you locate $60 on the x-axis, you notice the line is below zero. This means we’d lose money if the stock was at $60 at expiration—$350 to be precise. In this case, the long call would have no intrinsic value and expire worthless. Therefore, we’d be out the $350 premium plus transaction costs. This is the trade’s **maximum loss**, which is shown by the flat line moving to the left from $60. This indicates that if the underlying stock was anywhere below $60 at expiration, the trade would experience maximum loss.
