#### Reading a Risk Profile

The risk profile is another important piece of information commonly found in the options world. The  **risk profile**  is a chart that can help you identify the potential risk and return of an options trade, and how your trade is likely to perform based on the price of the underlying stock.

At first glance, a risk profile looks a lot like a price chart. However, a risk profile is very different. A price chart plots a stock’s market price over time. The y-axis of the chart shows price, while the x-axis serves as a timeline. A risk profile, on the other hand, plots a trader’s theoretical **profit/loss**  on the y-axis over the  **underlying stock price**  **at expiration**  on the x-axis. In other words, it tells you how much your position may gain or lose when the underlying stock is at a certain price at expiration.

To practice interpreting these profiles, let’s look at a few examples, starting with the risk profile for a **long call**. This is a very bullish strategy that can become more profitable as the price of the underlying increases.

Let’s say we bought the 60 call for a $350 premium. If you locate $60 on the x-axis, you notice the line is below zero. This means we’d lose money if the stock was at $60 at expiration—$350 to be precise. In this case, the long call would have no intrinsic value and expire worthless. Therefore, we’d be out the $350 premium plus transaction costs. This is the trade’s **maximum loss**, which is shown by the flat line moving to the left from $60. This indicates that if the underlying stock was anywhere below $60 at expiration, the trade would experience maximum loss.

What happens, though, if the price of the underlying is higher than $60? The plotted line starts to rise. Notice where the plotted line crosses the zero line. This is the **break-even point**.

A long call breaks even when the value of the option has gained enough to offset the amount we paid for the position. With this strategy, the break-even point is equal to the strike price plus the premium. In our example, that’s $63.50 ($60.00 + $3.50). If the underlying is above $63.50 at expiration, we’ll make money on the trade (not accounting for transaction costs and fees). And the higher the stock price is, the more profitable the trade will be. In fact, this strategy has the potential for **unlimited maximum gain**, represented by the line pointing up to the right.

Now let’s look at a risk profile for a **long put**. This is a bearish strategy that becomes more profitable as the price of the underlying decreases. Notice the differences between this profile and that of a long call. Essentially, this risk profile looks like a mirror image of the long call. Unlike the long call, which shows profits when the price of the underlying increases, this risk profile profits when the price of the underlying decreases.

Let’s look at another example. Suppose we bought the 40 put for $200. If you locate that price on the x-axis, you can see that we’ll lose money if the stock is at or above $40 at expiration. Specifically, we’ll lose $200, or the cost of the premium. As with the long call, the maximum loss is limited to our investment in the trade.

![](https://education.ameritrade.com/content/cms/images/BDTO_Lesson_3.30.07.jpg)

The plotted line crosses the zero line at $38—our break-even point. Once again, the premium has to be offset before the trade can start to make money. So the break-even point is the strike price minus the premium, which in this example is $38 ($40 – $2).

If the underlying is anywhere below $38 at expiration, we’ll make money—the plotted line is above the zero line. And the more the underlying falls, the more money we’ll make. However, the maximum gain with this strategy isn’t unlimited, as the underlying stock can only fall so far—to zero.
