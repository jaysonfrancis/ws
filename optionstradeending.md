#### How an Options Trade Might End

Whether you’re the buyer or the seller in an options trade, you need to understand the different ways the trade might end. Because an options trade can end in a few different ways, the end of a trade can be a surprise to many new traders. So let’s clear things up.

First, the outcome of a trade can vary depending on whether it ends before or at expiration. To start, we’ll look at what can happen  **before expiration**.

Buyers or sellers can typically  **close**  the trade by buying or selling the option back before expiration. Ideally, a buyer wants to sell back the option after its premium has increased in value, while a seller hopes its premium will decrease in value so she can buy it back at a lower price.

Often, sellers will close a trade before expiration to avoid assignment. This is common regardless of whether the trade is profitable or not. By closing a trade early, traders can avoid their obligations to buy or sell shares.

**Traders often choose to exit options trades before expiration**.

Second, both the buyer and seller are typically able to  **roll**  the trade at any time before expiration or assignment. Rolling a trade is when traders buy or sell back the existing option, and, in the same transaction, open another trade with the same underlying at a new expiration. Traders may choose to do this when they feel the current position is still a good idea and they believe they can potentially increase their profits, or they feel their losses on the previous trade may turn to gains with the new option.

For example, let’s say Trader A sold a call with a 45 strike that is expiring in 10 days. Trader A still has the same market outlook and thinks the trade is effective. He’d like to keep it going, but expiration is fast approaching. So Trader A buys back the 45 call to close the trade, and in the same transaction, sells another 45 call that expires in 40 days. That’s rolling the trade. It’s important to note that rolling strategies will entail additional transaction costs.

Third, the buyer can  **exercise the option**  any time before expiration. Except in rare cases, this is only done when the option is in the money.

Notice that while both buyers and sellers can close and roll trades, only buyers can exercise options. Exercising an option simply means exercising the right to buy or sell the specified number of shares at the specified price. However, just because an option is in the money doesn’t mean buyers  _have_ to exercise the option. They can also close the trade like we described earlier. If you wish to exercise an option, contact your broker.

**If a buyer chooses to exercise a call option, she’ll purchase 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price**.

When a buyer exercises an option, a seller gets  **assigned**. Assignment means that a seller is required to fulfill the obligations of the options contract, whether buying or selling shares. From the seller’s perspective, assignment can be a significant risk. Keep in mind, that this risk is generally only present when the short option has gone ITM.

The likelihood of assignment increases as an option approaches expiration, which is why many option sellers elect to exit trades around four to 10 days out. Doing so helps these sellers avoid assignment while still taking advantage of time decay. The likelihood of assignment also increases for short call positions when the underlying has a  **dividend**  distribution in the near future; as you’ve learned, in some cases, option buyers will exercise the option before the stock’s ex-dividend date so that they’re holding the shares in time to receive the dividend.

Okay, now let’s look at how options trades end  **at expiration**.

If an option is  **in the money**  by as little as $0.01 at expiration, it will be  **automatically exercised**  for the buyer and assigned to a seller. If you don’t want to exercise your option,  **close it before expiration**. If you are long an ITM option and  _don’t_  want to be automatically exercised, you should contact your broker.

If you don’t have the money and your option is exercised, you’ll be required to come up with the money, even if it means selling other assets. This is known as a  **margin call**. If you’re issued a margin call, your broker will likely notify you that you don’t have enough cash in your account to fulfill your obligations. You’re often given a specified amount of time to come up with the cash, and if you don’t, the broker will sell your assets until the loan is paid back. Note that the broker could liquidate positions immediately if necessary without notice.

If the option is exercised, the outcome is the same for the seller before and after expiration: assignment. Assignment has  **pros and cons**. If your goal was to get in or out of a stock through assignment, it can be convenient. But if you don’t want to buy or sell shares, assignment can be an unwelcome event, especially since it usually comes along with  **assignment fees** (which tend to be higher than standard trading fees). And if you don’t have the shares you committed to sell or the money for the shares you committed to buy, you could wind up in an unwanted short stock or margin call situation.

If an option is  **at the money**  when the market closes on the expiration date, it could be assigned. ATM options are subject to  **pin risk**, which is the risk that a stock is trading close to the strike price at expiration, leaving the seller uncertain about whether he’ll be assigned. If the seller is assigned and the price gaps against him at open the following Monday after expiration, the seller would have to take a loss on a position he wasn’t planning on holding. This risk can be avoided by closing your options (buying them back) before expiration.

Here’s an example of a pin risk situation. In the following example, Coca-Cola, which trades under ticker KO, closed exactly at $41.50 the day before the 1/15/16 expiration date.

If you’d sold the 41.50 call or put, you’d be subject to pin risk, which is the uncertainty of assignment. Depending on the actions taken by the seller, you may or may not be assigned the shares.

Whether you’re the buyer or the seller, it’s important to keep track of your trades’ expiration dates and where they’re trading (ITM, ATM, or OTM). If, as a buyer, you don’t want to exercise your option, or if, as the seller, you don’t want to get assigned, be prepared to keep an eye on your positions. And if you’re the seller, keep in mind that you can’t entirely protect yourself from assignment risk, but you can take steps in the right direction by closing your positions several days before expiration.
