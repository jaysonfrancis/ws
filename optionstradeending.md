#### How an Options Trade Might End

Whether you’re the buyer or the seller in an options trade, you need to understand the different ways the trade might end. Because an options trade can end in a few different ways, the end of a trade can be a surprise to many new traders. So let’s clear things up.

First, the outcome of a trade can vary depending on whether it ends before or at expiration. To start, we’ll look at what can happen  **before expiration**.

Buyers or sellers can typically  **close**  the trade by buying or selling the option back before expiration. Ideally, a buyer wants to sell back the option after its premium has increased in value, while a seller hopes its premium will decrease in value so she can buy it back at a lower price.
