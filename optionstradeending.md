#### How an Options Trade Might End

Whether you’re the buyer or the seller in an options trade, you need to understand the different ways the trade might end. Because an options trade can end in a few different ways, the end of a trade can be a surprise to many new traders. So let’s clear things up.

First, the outcome of a trade can vary depending on whether it ends before or at expiration. To start, we’ll look at what can happen  **before expiration**.

Buyers or sellers can typically  **close**  the trade by buying or selling the option back before expiration. Ideally, a buyer wants to sell back the option after its premium has increased in value, while a seller hopes its premium will decrease in value so she can buy it back at a lower price.

Often, sellers will close a trade before expiration to avoid assignment. This is common regardless of whether the trade is profitable or not. By closing a trade early, traders can avoid their obligations to buy or sell shares.

**Traders often choose to exit options trades before expiration**.

Second, both the buyer and seller are typically able to  **roll**  the trade at any time before expiration or assignment. Rolling a trade is when traders buy or sell back the existing option, and, in the same transaction, open another trade with the same underlying at a new expiration. Traders may choose to do this when they feel the current position is still a good idea and they believe they can potentially increase their profits, or they feel their losses on the previous trade may turn to gains with the new option.

For example, let’s say Trader A sold a call with a 45 strike that is expiring in 10 days. Trader A still has the same market outlook and thinks the trade is effective. He’d like to keep it going, but expiration is fast approaching. So Trader A buys back the 45 call to close the trade, and in the same transaction, sells another 45 call that expires in 40 days. That’s rolling the trade. It’s important to note that rolling strategies will entail additional transaction costs.
