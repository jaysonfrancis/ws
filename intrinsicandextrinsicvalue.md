#### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value

We’ve talked about the **3 largest factors** that comprise the options premium (1. price of the underlying, 2. time, 3. implied volatility). Option traders have another way of looking at the premium: intrinsic and extrinsic value.

**Intrinsic value** is the  **value an option has at expiration**, or the value an option would have if it expired right now. You can also think of it as the value that can’t be taken away from an option. Intrinsic value is calculated by taking the difference between the strike price and the current price of the underlying. For example, consider a long call option. A long call has intrinsic value if the strike price is lower than the current price—the intrinsic value is simply the difference between the two. Say XYZ is currently trading at $83. If you owned a long call with an 80 strike, your option would have $3 of intrinsic value.
