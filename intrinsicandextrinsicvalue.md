#### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value

We’ve talked about the **3 largest factors** that comprise the options premium (1. price of the underlying, 2. time, 3. implied volatility). Option traders have another way of looking at the premium: intrinsic and extrinsic value.

**Intrinsic value** is the  **value an option has at expiration**, or the value an option would have if it expired right now. You can also think of it as the value that can’t be taken away from an option. Intrinsic value is calculated by taking the difference between the strike price and the current price of the underlying. For example, consider a long call option. A long call has intrinsic value if the strike price is lower than the current price—the intrinsic value is simply the difference between the two. Say XYZ is currently trading at $83. If you owned a long call with an 80 strike, your option would have $3 of intrinsic value.

A long put, on the other hand, has intrinsic value if the strike price is higher than the current price of the underlying. Say FAHN is currently trading at $119. If you owned a long put with a 124 strike, your option would have $5 of intrinsic value.

Intrinsic value is just one part of the equation. We also need to factor in  **extrinsic value**. This is  **the**  **value**  **of an option due to time and implied volatility**. These factors represent an options premium’s  _potential_  to increase in value before expiration. An option with more time to expiration has more time to make a move up or down, which translates to more extrinsic value. Likewise, an option with more implied volatility means that the underlying stock is perceived as riskier, and therefore, more likely to make a large move up or down. Once again, this translates to more extrinsic value.

**Extrinsic value is the value attributed to both time and implied volatility**.

These are the two primary components of extrinsic value, but factors like interest rates and dividends play a lesser role. Another way to think about it is that extrinsic value is the value that’s left over if you subtract intrinsic value from the options premium. Let’s look at an example using our same long call on XYZ, which has $3 of intrinsic value. Say this option sold for a $5 premium. To figure out the extrinsic value, subtract the intrinsic value from the premium ($5 – $3), which is $2.

Intrinsic and extrinsic value are important to option traders because they help traders differentiate between the inherent value of an option and the rest of the value that will melt away by expiration. When you consider that buyers suffer from the loss of extrinsic value while option sellers benefit from this loss, you can see how this is valuable information. As you’ll see when we get into the strategies, **selecting the option with the right amount of extrinsic or intrinsic value is a necessary step when trading options.**

Now, let’s look at intrinsic value another way. Depending on how much intrinsic value they have, options are classified as **in the money, at the money, or out of the money**.

Options with intrinsic value are classified as  **in the money (ITM)**. Remember, a call has intrinsic value when the strike is below the current price, and a put has intrinsic value when the strike is above the current price.

ITM options have intrinsic value, and for this reason, premiums for ITM options are often more expensive. The more ITM an option is, the more confident traders feel that the option will expire in the money (though there are never guarantees). After all, an option that is currently in the money is more likely to be in the money at expiration than an option that’s out of the money. Another important consideration for ITM options is that they’re more likely to be exercised. This is particularly important when you’re an option seller. When an option you’ve sold has gone ITM, your risk of being assigned increases significantly. Generally, this risk increases as an option approaches expiration. If an option expires ITM, it’ll likely be automatically exercised.

If an option has no intrinsic value, it’s  **out of the money (OTM)**. A call is OTM when the strike price is higher than the current price of the underlying security, and a put is OTM when the strike price is lower than the current price of the underlying security. OTM options prices are entirely made up of extrinsic value.

Because extrinsic value melts away over time, options that are OTM at expiration will expire worthless. Likewise, except in rare situations, these options go unassigned. The premiums for OTM options tend to be less expensive. The further OTM an option is, the cheaper it is and the more confident traders are that it’ll expire out of the money. But all options are subject to price risk, or the possibility that the price of the underlying stock could make an unexpected move.

The strike price that’s closest to the current price of the underlying is called the  **at-the-money (ATM)**  strike. The ATM strike could also be considered ITM (if the strike has intrinsic value) or OTM (if the strike has no extrinsic value).

ATM options have the largest amount of extrinsic value of any option. Because the ATM strike price is the closest to the current market price, there’s a lot of uncertainty—it could be ITM or OTM at expiration. However, because these options often have little or no intrinsic value, they tend to have lower premiums than other ITM options. An ATM option may or may not have intrinsic value, and therefore, it may or may not be exercised before or at expiration. Anytime an option has intrinsic value, its risk of being exercised greatly increases. And an option that expires with intrinsic value will likely be automatically exercised. It’s worth noting that there are rare situations where an option that’s OTM is exercised. However, these situations are far from the norm.

The value of an option changes over the course of a trade. Depending on what happens with price, time, and implied volatility, an option can start out in the money but expire out of the money. Or it can start out of the money and expire in the money. ITM, OTM, and ATM are helpful quick references that clue option traders into whether an option has intrinsic value and whether it’s likely to be exercised. As we get into specific strategies, you’ll learn more about how these classifications factor into trading decisions.
