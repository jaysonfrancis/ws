#### Intrinsic and Extrinsic Value

We’ve talked about the **3 largest factors** that comprise the options premium (1. price of the underlying, 2. time, 3. implied volatility). Option traders have another way of looking at the premium: intrinsic and extrinsic value.

**Intrinsic value** is the  **value an option has at expiration**, or the value an option would have if it expired right now. You can also think of it as the value that can’t be taken away from an option. Intrinsic value is calculated by taking the difference between the strike price and the current price of the underlying. For example, consider a long call option. A long call has intrinsic value if the strike price is lower than the current price—the intrinsic value is simply the difference between the two. Say XYZ is currently trading at $83. If you owned a long call with an 80 strike, your option would have $3 of intrinsic value.

A long put, on the other hand, has intrinsic value if the strike price is higher than the current price of the underlying. Say FAHN is currently trading at $119. If you owned a long put with a 124 strike, your option would have $5 of intrinsic value.

Intrinsic value is just one part of the equation. We also need to factor in  **extrinsic value**. This is  **the**  **value**  **of an option due to time and implied volatility**. These factors represent an options premium’s  _potential_  to increase in value before expiration. An option with more time to expiration has more time to make a move up or down, which translates to more extrinsic value. Likewise, an option with more implied volatility means that the underlying stock is perceived as riskier, and therefore, more likely to make a large move up or down. Once again, this translates to more extrinsic value.

**Extrinsic value is the value attributed to both time and implied volatility**.

These are the two primary components of extrinsic value, but factors like interest rates and dividends play a lesser role. Another way to think about it is that extrinsic value is the value that’s left over if you subtract intrinsic value from the options premium. Let’s look at an example using our same long call on XYZ, which has $3 of intrinsic value. Say this option sold for a $5 premium. To figure out the extrinsic value, subtract the intrinsic value from the premium ($5 – $3), which is $2.
