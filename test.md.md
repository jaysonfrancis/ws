#### Options Contract Specifications

In this lesson, we'll focus on the core concepts of options trading - the fundamental ideas you need to understand in order to trade options. First, we'll revisit the specifications of an options contract that you just learned about and then cover them in more detail.

We'll also examine exactly what makes certain contracts work the way they do, including what's going on in an options trade between a buyer, a seller, and the underlying stock. 

Let's start with a quick review of what you've learned already. An options contract gives a buyer the right to buy or sell a set quantity of stock at a certain price before a certain date. A standard options contract controls <b>100 shares</b>  of an underlying security. The price of the contract is known as the <b>premium</b>; buyers pay it and sellers collect it. And as the value of the underlying changes, the value of the option changes as well. The price at which the buyer has the right to purchase or sell shares is called the <b> strike price</b>. This right is only good up to a certain date known as the <b>expiration</b>.

Now that we've reviewed some of the basics, let's dig into why options work the way they do. To start, there are two types of options contracts: <b>call options</b> and <b>put options</b>. Both are very similar - they have nearly identical specifications (premium, strike, expirations, etc..). However, the one important difference is that the buyers of each have different rights. 

With calls, the buyer has the <b>right to buy</b> stock. However, puts, a buyer as the <b>right to sell</b> stock.

While options traders can own the underlying when trading a call or a put, they don't have to. In the case of puts, this might seem a little confusing. After all, it's a little strange that someone would want to have the right to sell something they don't own. We'll explore this more in am
