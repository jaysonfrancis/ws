#### Options Contract Specifications

In this lesson, we'll focus on the core concepts of options trading - the fundamental ideas you need to understand in order to trade options. First, we'll revisit the specifications of an options contract that you just learned about and then cover them in more detail.

We'll also examine exactly what makes certain contracts work the way they do, including what's going on in an options trade between a buyer, a seller, and the underlying stock. 

Let's start with a quick review of what you've learned already. An options contract gives a buyer the right to buy or sell a set quantity of stock at a certain price before a certain date. A standard options contract controls <b>100 shares</b>  of an underlying security. The price of the contract is known as the <b>premium</b>; buyers pay it and sellers collect it. And as the value of the underlying changes, the value of the option changes as well. The price at which the buyer has the right to purchase or sell shares is called the <b> strike price</b>. This right is only good up to a certain date known as the <b>expiration</b>.

Now that we've reviewed some of the basics, let's dig into why options work the way they do. To start, there are two types of options contracts: <b>call options</b> and <b>put options</b>. Both are very similar - they have nearly identical specifications (premium, strike, expirations, etc..). However, the one important difference is that the buyers of each have different rights. 

With calls, the buyer has the <b>right to buy</b> stock. However, puts, a buyer as the <b>right to sell</b> stock.

While options traders can own the underlying when trading a call or a put, they don't have to. In the case of puts, this might seem a little confusing. After all, it's a little strange that someone would want to have the right to sell something they don't own. We'll explore this more in a moment, but what's more important to understand is how this specification impacts the options premium. Te result of this difference is that calls and puts have a different bias - call options gain value when the price of the underlying stock <b>increases</b>, while put options gain value when the price of the underlying stock <b>decreases</b>.

For this reason, buying a call option is similar to buying a stock - it's a <b>long</b> or bullish position. Buying a put option, on the other hand, is similar to <b>shorting</b> a stock - it's bearish. 

Let's dive in the details of how each option works, starting with <b>calls</b>. A call option gives the buyer the <b>right to buy</b> 100 shares of an underlying security at the strike price before the expiration date. It <b>obligates the seller to sell</b> 100 shares.

To help illustrate how this works, let's walk through a quick example. Stock XYZ is currently trading at $75. Trader A expects stock XYZ to go up in value, so she. buys a call option with a 76 strike price of $1.50, for a total cost of $150. Remember a call option gains value as the price of the underlying increases. Trader B thinks XYZ is going to stay around the same value or go down, so she takes the other side of the trade and sells the option.

Now, if the stock price stays below the 76 strike until expiration, the buyer has no reason to exercise her right (who wants to buy a stock for more than it's worth?), and the option expires worthless. She's out of the $150 premium, which the seller received when the option was sold (not including transaction costs).

On the other hand, if the stock price rises above the 76 strike, the option will likely have increased in value. Assume the stock price continues to $79. Now, the buyer has an opportunity to buy a stock that the market values at $79 for a price of $76. This situation can have considerable value. In fact, in this scenario, if the buyer sold her contract at this point, her potential profits would likely be significantly larger than the seller’s profits in the previous scenario.

At this point, the buyer could either exit the trade by selling the contract back for a higher price than she originally paid or exercise the contract to purchase 100 shares at the strike price.

Now, let’s take a closer look at puts. A  **put** option gives the buyer the  **right to sell**  100 shares of an underlying security at the strike price before the expiration date. This is different from the options examples you’ve seen up to this point because we’ve primarily been talking about call options. But as you can probably guess, a put  **obligates the seller to buy** 100 shares of the underlying stock at the strike price.

Like we mentioned earlier, the contract specifications of puts can be a little tricky to understand. For example, assuming you don’t already own shares of the underlying, how can you sell something you don’t own? Well, it comes down to timing. You don’t need to own the shares when you buy the put option—all that matters is that you can fulfill your end of the deal when the trade is closed. So, even if you don’t own the stock, you could buy it at the current market price before you exercise the option and then effectively sell it (or “put” it) to the option seller with the exercise.

To illustrate this, let’s look at another example. This time, let’s say stock FAMB is trading at $61. Trader C thinks the stock price is going to go down, so he buys a single put option with a 60 strike for $200. He doesn’t currently own any shares of FAMB. Meanwhile, Trader D thinks FAMB is going to increase in price, so he takes the other side of the trade and sells the put option.

If the stock stays above $60 through expiration, the option expires worthless. After all, why would you sell a stock far below its current market value? The buyer—Trader C—is out the $200 premium, while the seller—Trader D—is able to keep the premium he received.

On the other hand, if FAMB falls below $60 to $55, Trader C is in a position to exercise his option and sell the underlying at a higher price than its current market value. Even if Trader C has to buy 100 shares of FAMB for $5,500 (plus commissions and fees) before he can exercise his right to sell, he could make a profit of approximately $500 since he’s got a buyer locked in at $60 per share. Trader C could also choose to close the position by selling the options contract, and earn about the same amount of profit by doing so.

The table below summarizes calls and puts from both the buyer and seller perspectives. Notice the different rights and obligations and the direction or bias of each position.

Note that the examples we’ve looked at on this page have been simplified to illustrate the contract specifications of calls and puts. In these examples, we’ve focused just on price changes in the underlying stock and how that impacts various options. However, price is just **one part** of an options premium. In the remainder of this lesson, we’ll layer in additional factors and show how they too impact an options premium.
